[Report on the Python Software Foundation's participation in the 2007 Google Summer of Code](http://www.python.org/psf/reports/gsoc-2007/)

With the 2008 Google Summer of Code just around the bend, we present this report. James Tauber was the PSF administrator for the 2007 Google Summer of Code. James and I are both to blame for the lateness of this report, although me much more than he (I've been sitting on it since December). Better late than never!
