The Python Software Foundation is soliciting nominations for the second quarter 2010 [community awards](http://www.python.org/community/awards/psf-awards/).

The PSF Community Awards are a way for the PSF Board of Directors to recognize contributions by community members that significantly improve the Foundation's fulfillment of its mission and benefits the broader Python community.

Recognition takes the form of an award certificate plus one of the following:

> 1.  A cash award of $500; or
> 2.  Free registration at PyCon, with optionally a contribution of up to $500 towards the recipient's travel and accommodation expenses.

Awards are normally made quarterly, although the Board may choose to consider awards at other times. Membership in the Foundation is not required to receive an award.

PSF members should submit confidential nominations to the Board by sending email to [psf@python.org](mailto:psf@python.org).
