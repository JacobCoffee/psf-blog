The PSF Board chose in the first quarter of this year to honor two individuals who have both given outstanding service to PyCon. For the first time framed certificates were actually presented to the recipients in person at the conference. Ken Whitesell has been a PyCon supporter for a very long time. It's hard to remember a time when Ken wasn't working behind the reception desk to make sure that delegates received all the help they need. Ken has also done sterling work in presenting many tutorials at PyCon, and has evangelized Python to the commercial world over a long period. Yarko Tymciurak has provided several years meritorious service in developing and maintaining electronic registration and payment systems for PyCon. He has also shown exceptional dedication to providing high levels of customer service to both delegates and sponsors, going above and beyond the call of duty in assisting with registration issues. Many thanks to both Ken and Yarko. We hope to see you both at PyCon again next year.
