The Foundation wishes to thank Carl Trachte and Audrey Roy for their work in the Python community with [Community Service Awards](http://www.python.org/community/awards/psf-awards/) for the first quarter of 2012. Carl has put significant effort into diversifying and supporting non-English speaking writers for the Python Wiki. Audrey also put in a lot of time diversifying the community with her work in creating the PyLadies group as well speaking on outreach issues as numerous conferences. On behalf of the Python community, the PSF thanks Carl and Audrey for their time and effort!
