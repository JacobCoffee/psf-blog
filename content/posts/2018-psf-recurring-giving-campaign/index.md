The PSF is launching an end-of-year fundraising drive to build a sustainable community of supporters. Our goal is to raise $30,000! You can help by signing up to give monthly or if you’re already a supporting member (Thank You!!), by checking the box to renew your membership automatically. The drive begins October 22 and concludes November 21, 2018. **Your donations have IMPACT** Over $118,543 was awarded in financial aid to 143 PyCon attendees in 2018.  
$240,000 has been paid in grants from January through September 2018 to recipients in 45 different countries. Some examples of how your donation dollars are spent:

-   $35,000 was provided to the Python Core Development Sprint in 2018
-   $20,000 helps support 11 Python conferences, impacting over 3,000 people globally
-   $20,000 helps support ~25 hands-on workshops impacting over 700 people
-   $10,000 supports user group meetup fees for 150 groups for 6 months
-   $5,000 provides hosting for 3-4 PSF community web services for a year(e.g. Mail.python.org, uspycon.org, wiki.python.org)
-   $1,000 helps supports 2 regional conferences, impacting over 500 people
-   $50 supports a Python meetup group for 3 months
