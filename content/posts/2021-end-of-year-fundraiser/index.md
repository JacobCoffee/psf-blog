*Summary: The PSF launched its end-of-the-year fundraiser. There are two ways to donate: 1. [donate directly to the PSF](https://psfmember.org/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&id=36) or 2. [purchase a discounted PyCharm license](https://lp.jetbrains.com/support-python/), with all proceeds going to the PSF. Contributing to the PSF financially helps sustain programs that support the larger Python community.*

2021 is flying by! Regardless, the PSF made the best of this year by launching two critical initiatives thanks to Google's sponsorship and Bloomberg's grant. We're super happy to now support Python core development and Python Packaging in new ways:

-   Core Development: In July 2021, the PSF hired its inaugural Developer-in-Residence, Łukasz Langa. Łukasz works full-time (one year term) to assist CPython maintainers and the Python Steering Council. Areas of responsibility include analytical research to understand the project's volunteer hours, investigating project priorities and tasks as we advance, and working on those priorities.
-   Packaging: In August 2021, the PSF hired its first-ever Python Packaging Project Manager, Shamika Mohanan. Shamika is performing outreach to Python users to help the PSF better understand the landscape, identify fundable initiatives, seek grants, oversee funded projects, and report on their progress and results to improve Python packaging for all users.

To continue the above initiatives, the PSF will need to generate **USD 325,000 per year**. To hire additional folks for either initiative (in demand), the PSF will need **USD 500,000+ per year**. The amount of funding required is in addition to funding needed to maintain PyCon US, our fiscal sponsor program, several working groups, an international grants program, a healthy financial reserve, and a growing staff to operate the PSF. Even if donations are a portion of the PSF's revenue, every dollar makes an impact and allows the PSF financial stability to continue supporting a growing community!
