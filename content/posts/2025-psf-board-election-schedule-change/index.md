Starting this year, the PSF Board Election will be held a couple of months later in the year than in years prior. The nomination period through the end of the vote will run around the August to September time frame. This is due to several factors:  

-   Planning the Board election while organizing PyCon US is a strain on both PSF Staff and Board Members who assist with the election.
-   We received feedback that nominees would appreciate more time between the nomination cutoff and the start of the vote so that they can campaign.
-   There are several US holidays in June and July (and PyCon US recovery!), which means PSF Staff will intermittently be out of the office. We want to ensure we are ready and available to assist with memberships, election questions, nominations, and everything else election-related!

A detailed election schedule will be published in June.  

### Consider running for the PSF Board!

In the meantime, we hope that folks in the Python community consider running for a seat on the PSF Board! Wondering who runs for the Board? People who care about the Python community, who want to see it flourish and grow, and also have a few hours a month to attend regular meetings, serve on committees, participate in conversations, and promote the Python community. Check out our [Life as Python Software Foundation Director video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLKj6FaQA4M) to learn more about what being a part of the PSF Board entails. You can also check out our [FAQ’s with the PSF Board video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD6cPBfR4A4) on the PSF YouTube Channel. If you’re headed to [PyCon US 2025](https://us.pycon.org/2025/) next month, that’s a great time to connect with [current and past Board Members](https://www.python.org/psf/board/). We also invite you to review our [Annual Impact Report for 2023](https://www.python.org/psf/annual-report/2023/) to learn more about the PSF’s mission and what we do. Last but not least, we welcome you to join the [PSF Board Office Hours](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/08/ask-questions-or-tell-us-what-you-think.html) to connect with Board members about being a part of the PSF Board!
