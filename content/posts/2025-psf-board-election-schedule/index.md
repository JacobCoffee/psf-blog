The PSF Board elections are a chance for the community to choose representatives to help the Python Software Foundation create a vision for and build the future of the Python community. This year, there are 4 seats open on the PSF Board. Check out who is currently on the board on [the PSF's website](https://www.python.org/psf/board/). (Dawn Wages, Jannis Leidel, Kushal Das, and Simon Willison are at the end of their current terms.) As [we previously shared](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/04/2025-psf-board-election-schedule-change.html), the Board election will take place a little later this year to better serve our community and ease pressure on PSF Staff.

## Voting

You must be a Contributing, Supporting, or Fellow member by August 26th and affirm your intention to vote to participate in this election. If you are currently a Managing member, you will receive a communication soon notifying you that your membership type will be changed to Contributing per last year’s [Bylaw change that merged Managing and Contributing memberships](https://github.com/psf/bylaws/compare/a35a6071de181adbb7a160d5d1447e7b0272359c...359cbc540f2f6bf00bc46b9dbe3e00a950612c27). Check out the [PSF membership page](https://www.python.org/psf/membership/) to learn more about membership classes and benefits. You can affirm your voting intention by following the steps in [our video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWfyvPqAAJs):  

-   Log in to psfmember.org
-   Check your eligibility to vote (You must be a Contributing, Supporting, or Fellow member)
-   Choose “Voting Affirmation” at the top right
-   Select your preferred intention for voting in 2025
-   Click the “Submit” button

Per another recent [Bylaw change that allows for simplifying the voter affirmation process by treating past voting activity as intent to continue voting](https://github.com/python/psf-bylaws/compare/a35a6071de181adbb7a160d5d1447e7b0272359c...6bac449), if you cast your ballot last year, you will automatically be added to the 2025 voter roll. Please note that if you removed or changed your email on psfmember.org, you may not automatically be added to this year's voter roll. If you have questions about membership, please email psf-elections@pyfound.org.

## Run for the Board

Who runs for the board? People who care about the Python community, who want to see it flourish and grow, and also have a few hours a month to attend regular meetings, serve on committees, participate in conversations, and promote the Python community.

You can nominate yourself or someone else. We would encourage you to reach out to folks before you nominate them to make sure they are enthusiastic about the potential of joining the Board. Nominations open on Tuesday, July 29th, 2:00 pm UTC, so you have time to talk with potential nominees, research the role, and craft a nomination statement for yourself or others. Take a look at [last year’s nomination statements](https://www.python.org/nominations/elections/2024-python-software-foundation-board/nominees/) for reference.
