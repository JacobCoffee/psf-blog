Greetings, Pythonistas- thank you so much for supporting the work of the PSF and the Python community! The newest PSF Board has decided to continue investing in connecting with the global Python community by running the PSF Board Office Hour sessions on the [PSF Discord](https://discord.gg/4Hm36PPgpG) into 2026. We began running these sessions in September 2024, and they have proven to be a great method for the community to connect with the board and vice versa. The sessions have provided the PSF Board and Staff the opportunity to hear what our community is up to and what challenges they are facing, as well as receive invaluable feedback about how the PSF can continue to improve our service to the Python community.  

## What are the PSF Board Office Hours?

During the PSF Board Office Hours, you can participate in a **text-based live chat** with PSF Board Directors. This is a chance to connect, share, and collaborate with the PSF Board and Staff to improve our community together. Occasionally, we will have dedicated topics such as PyCon US and the PSF Board Elections for the office hour sessions. Here is some of the work that we collaborate with staff and volunteers on:

-   Promotion and outreach for the Python programming language
-   Supporting local Python communities
-   Organizing PyCon US
-   Diversity and Inclusion in our community
-   Support handling Code of Conduct issues within our communities
-   Furthering [the mission of the PSF](https://www.python.org/psf/mission/)

  
Unless we have a dedicated topic for a session, you are not limited to talking with us about the above topics, although the discussions should be focused on Python, the PSF, and our community. If you think there’s something we can help with or we should know, we welcome you to come and talk to us!  

## Joining the office hours

The office hour sessions will take place on the PSF Discord server in the #psf-board channel. If you are new to Discord, make sure to check out [a tutorial on how you can download the app and sign up for free](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033931551-Getting-Started)– then join us on the [PSF Discord](https://discord.gg/4Hm36PPgpG)! To make the office hours more accessible, the office hours will be scheduled at alternating times, so no matter where you are based, you can find a time that is most convenient for you! Here is a list of the dates and times:

-   November 4th, 2 pm UTC

Each session lasts for an hour. Sessions after October 2026 will be announced in the future.  

## Who will be at the office hours?

Some board members of the PSF will be attending each office hour, as well as members of the PSF Staff. The [list of the current PSF Board Directors](https://www.python.org/psf/board/#id33) can be found on our website. We are passionate Python community members who are excited to listen, help, and provide support to you. We are happy to follow up with you if there are any issues we cannot address immediately during the office hour sessions. As always, you can email us at psf-board@python.org with inquiries, feedback, or comments any time.
