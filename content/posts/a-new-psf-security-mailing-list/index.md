The Python community takes security very seriously. In an effort to enhance security and promote transparency about security matters, the [Python Security Response Team](https://www.python.org/news/security/) (PSRT) has created a [security-announce](https://mail.python.org/mm3/mailman3/lists/security-announce.python.org/) mailing list. This mailing list will allow the PSRT to communicate about security-related matters to anyone in the Python community who signs up. Join this list to stay on top of the most recent [security fixes](https://python-security.readthedocs.io/) to the Python language. Click [here](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2017-September/149618.html) to learn more about the mailing list and to sign up!
