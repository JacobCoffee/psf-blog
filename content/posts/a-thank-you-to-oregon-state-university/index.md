The Python Software Foundation has had infrastructure hosted with the [Oregon State University Open Source Lab (OSUOSL)](https://osuosl.org/) since 2012. For many years our core infrastructure was hosted there, and to this day the host our x86 benchmark server for CPython that feeds speed.python.org.

We are saddened to hear that The Open Source Lab at Oregon State University has reached a [funding crisis point](https://osuosl.org/blog/osl-future/), and want to send our heartfelt gratitude to Lance, the student employees, and teams of volunteers who have provided infrastructure to projects like us since their inception in 2004.
