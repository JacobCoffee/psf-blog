Every PSF voting-eligible Member (Supporting, Contributing, and Fellow) needs to affirm their membership to vote in this year’s election.

**If you wish to vote in this year’s PSF Board election, you must affirm your intention to vote no later than Tuesday, August 26th, 2:00 pm UTC.** This year’s Board Election vote begins Tuesday, September 2nd, 2:00 pm UTC, and closes on Tuesday, September 16th, 2:00 pm UTC.

You should have received an email from "psf@psfmember.org <Python Software Foundation>" with the subject "\[Action Required\] Affirm your PSF Membership voting intention for 2025 PSF Board Election" that contains information on how to affirm your voting status. If you were expecting to receive the email but have not (make sure to check your spam!), please email psf-elections@pyfound.org, and we’ll assist you. *Please note: If you opted out of emails related to your membership, you did not receive this email.*

#### Need to check your membership status?

Log on to psfmember.org and visit your [PSF Member User Information page](https://psfmember.org/user-information) to see your membership record and status. If you are a voting-eligible member (active Supporting, Contributing, and Fellow members of the PSF) and do not already have a login, please [create an account on psfmember.org](https://psfmember.org/wp-login.php?action=register) and then email psf-elections@pyfound.org so we can link your membership to your account. Please ensure you have an account linked to your membership so that we can have the most up-to-date contact information for you in the future.

#### How to affirm your intention to vote

You can affirm your voting intention by following the steps in [our video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWfyvPqAAJs):  

-   Log in to psfmember.org
-   Check your eligibility to vote (You must be a Contributing, Supporting, or Fellow member)
-   Choose “[Voting Affirmation](https://psfmember.org/civicrm/votingaffirmation/)” at the top right
-   Select your preferred intention for voting in 2025
-   Click the “Submit” button

#### PSF Bylaws

Section 4.2 of the [PSF Bylaws](https://www.python.org/psf/bylaws/) requires that “Members of any membership class with voting rights must affirm each year to the corporation in writing that such member intends to be a voting member for such year.”

Our motivation is to ensure that our elections can meet quorum as required by Section 3.9 of [our bylaws](https://www.python.org/psf/bylaws/). As our membership has grown, we have seen that an increasing number of Contributing and Fellow members with indefinite membership do not engage with our annual election, making quorum difficult to reach.

An election that does not reach quorum is invalid. This would cause the whole voting process to be re-held, resulting in fewer voters and an undue amount of effort on the part of PSF Staff.

#### Recent updates to membership and voting

If you were formerly a Managing member, your membership has been updated to Contributing as of June 25th, 2025, per last year’s [Bylaw change that merged Managing and Contributing memberships](https://github.com/psf/bylaws/compare/a35a6071de181adbb7a160d5d1447e7b0272359c...359cbc540f2f6bf00bc46b9dbe3e00a950612c27). Per another recent Bylaw change that allows for [simplifying the voter affirmation process by treating past voting activity as intent to continue voting](https://github.com/python/psf-bylaws/compare/a35a6071de181adbb7a160d5d1447e7b0272359c...6bac449), if you voted last year, you will automatically be added to the 2025 voter roll. *Please note: If you removed or changed your email on psfmember.org, you may not automatically be added to this year's voter roll.*  

#### What happens next?

You’ll get an email from OpaVote with a ballot on or right before September 2nd, and then you can vote!
