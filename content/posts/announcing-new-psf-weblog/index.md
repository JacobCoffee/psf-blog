The Python Software Foundation is pleased to announce that we now have a weblog for posting announcements, requests for help, calls for discussion, organizational news such as meeting minutes, and PyCon-related news. The PSF does many things, but often hasn't been very active in publishing the details. I hope the existence of this weblog will provide the community with more insight into what's going on. At today's IRC meeting of the PSF Board, we voted on, and accepted, [a weblog policy](http://www.python.org/psf/weblog-policy/) that forms a set of guidelines about what can be posted here. No weblog editor has been appointed yet. Some of you may remember that I posted a call for an editor to psf-members last summer and got a number of responses at the time. I've since ditched the SVN-based approach and set up this Blogger-hosted weblog instead, so I'll be contacting the volunteers to see if they're still interested.
