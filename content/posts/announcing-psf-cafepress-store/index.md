Thanks to Tim Parkin's volunteer work, the PSF now has a CafePress storefront at [www.cafepress.com/pydotorg](http://www.cafepress.com/pydotorg).

You can order T-shirts, hats, and stickers featuring the blue-and-yellow Python logo and the yellow-and-black PyCon logo. About 25% of the sale price will be returned to the PSF to help fund our activities.
