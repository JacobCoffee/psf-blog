The PSF Community Service Awards (CSA’s) are a formal way for the PSF Board of Directors to offer recognition of work which, in its opinion, significantly improves the Foundation's fulfillment of its mission and benefits the broader Python community. These awards shine a light on the incredible people who are the heart and soul of our community– those whose dedication, creativity, and generosity help the PSF fulfill its mission. The PSF CSAs celebrate individuals who have been truly invaluable, inspiring others through their example, and demonstrates that service to the Python community leads to recognition and reward. If you know of someone in the Python community deserving of a PSF CSA award, please submit them to the PSF Board via psf@python.org at any time. You can read more about [PSF CSAs on our website](https://www.python.org/community/awards/psf-awards/). The PSF Board is excited to announce three new CSAs, awarded to Katie McLaughlin, Sarah Kuchinsky, and Rodrigo Girão Serrão, for their contributions to the Python community. Read more about their contributions and impact below.

## Katie McLaughlin

Katie has been a tireless and dedicated member of the Python and Django communities for many years. They have served on the boards of both the DSF and PSF, including as PSF Communications Officer, and was named a PSF Fellow in 2018. Katie has played a big role in the Australian conference community– chairing DjangoCon AU 2017, PyCon AU in 2018 and 2019, and co-chairing PyCon AU 2021– and continues to support PyCon AU as an advisor.

A frequent speaker and keynote presenter at PyCons and DjangoCons around the world, Katie has worked to demystify Python website deployment, highlight the value of all kinds of open source contributions, and call out the impact of contempt culture on developer communities. They are also a regular at sprints, helping new contributors get started and improving onboarding through code and documentation.

## Sarah Kuchinsky

Sarah has been the driving force behind PyCon tutorials for many years, shaping them into the strong program they are today. She has brought skill, care, and consistency to the difficult work of selecting, organizing, and running tutorials, ensuring they provide meaningful learning experiences for attendees.

Beyond logistics, Sarah has a gift for spotting and nurturing talent. She has encouraged new volunteers to grow into leadership roles, building a resilient, collaborative committee that sustains itself year after year. Her outreach has kept reviewers engaged while also welcoming fresh voices, strengthening both the program and the community behind it.

The impact of Sarah’s work is felt by every instructor, attendee, and volunteer who has benefitted from PyCon tutorials, and the community is deeply grateful for her many years of leadership and care. Sarah was also the lead organizer for PyLadies Silicon Valley for over 5 years, is a SoCal Python Co-Organizer, and has contributed to a variety of open source projects.

## Rodrigo Girão Serrão

Rodrigo Girão Serrão has made lasting contributions to the international Python community through his leadership, teaching, and generosity. He has helped organize PyCons in Portugal, supported the Python community across Europe, and spoken regularly at PyCons worldwide, making complex topics like descriptors clear and approachable.

Through his website mathspp.com, bootcamps, and self-published books, including the freely available Pydon’ts book, Rodrigo has worked to make Python more accessible and welcoming. His dedication to sharing knowledge and supporting others has had a wide-reaching impact, and the community is grateful for his many contributions.
