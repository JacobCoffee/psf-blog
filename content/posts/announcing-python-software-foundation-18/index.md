Thank you for your continued contributions. We have added you to our [Fellows Roster](https://www.python.org/psf/fellows-roster/).

The above members help support the Python ecosystem by being phenomenal leaders, sustaining the growth of the Python scientific community, maintaining virtual Python communities, maintaining Python libraries, creating educational material, organizing Python events and conferences, starting Python communities in local regions, and overall being great mentors in our community. Each of them continues to help make Python more accessible around the world. To learn more about the new Fellow members, check out their links above.

Let's continue recognizing Pythonistas all over the world for their impact on our community. The criteria for Fellow members is available on our [PSF Fellow Membership page](https://www.python.org/psf/fellows). If you would like to nominate someone to be a PSF Fellow, please send a description of their Python accomplishments and their email address to psf-fellow at python.org. Quarter 4 nominations will be in review soon. We are accepting nominations for Quarter 4 of 2025 through November 20th, 2025.
