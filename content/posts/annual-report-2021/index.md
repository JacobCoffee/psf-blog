2021 was a challenging and exciting year for the PSF. We’ve done our best to capture some of the key numbers, details, and context in [our latest annual report](https://www.python.org/psf/annual-report/2021/). Some highlights of what you’ll find in the annual report include:

-   PyCon US 2021 by the numbers  
    
-   Where we sent grant funding in 2021
