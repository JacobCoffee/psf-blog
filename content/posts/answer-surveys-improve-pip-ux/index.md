The [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/) team has been working on improving the usability of pip since the start of this year. We've been carrying this work out remotely - by interviewing pip users, by sending short surveys, and doing usability tests of new pip functions.

We want to thank everybody who is contributing input to this work and are taking part in this research, which is still ongoing. We've learned a lot about who uses pip and how you use it. This has helped the team make decisions to improve pip, such as [error messages and documentation to help you fix dependency conflicts](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#fixing-conflicting-dependencies).

Our team has put together a [User Experience (UX) section in pip's documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/ux_research_design/) to tell you about this UX work. It covers what has happened so far, how you can contribute, and what is coming in the future.

### Contribute to current UX work

Right now, you can take part in a number of studies about:

1.  What pip features do you use most, and what pip feature you'd like to see - [give your input by completing this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1N-sE0LxdfZb2OUsBcwNILabnpPsb71IRAMWD9CKY6Uk/)
2.  How "pip force install" should behave - [give your input by completing this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1otpC59Yo667l9fiPPLPz8ivKr4GO3atXwy-B6pFhL1U)
3.  How "pip --force-reinstall" should behave - [give your input by completing this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1S2sAQMCmqJiS4Qp4HnRH196ph4oiS0nRhg9FgZMJzbg)
4.  Help create a design brief for a pip logo - [give your input by completing this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/17zzrIQVt-UymVSWPlKVZdci1HqNIvSGXmhNJbL9DYdA)
5.  What is your experience of using pip search - [give your input by completing this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-4kiVV8NnlkBrCr6x7eb8SobnS1RVRAR2xEl8iUeu24)

If you have time, the team asks for you to answer all of these surveys. You can do them in your own time, all at once or over a few days.

At the end of these surveys you can give your email address to be contacted for a short interview. These interviews will be via web conference/videocall.
