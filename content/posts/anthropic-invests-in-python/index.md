We are thrilled to announce that Anthropic has entered into a two-year partnership with the Python Software Foundation (PSF) to contribute a landmark total of $1.5 million to support the foundation’s work, with an emphasis on Python ecosystem security. This investment will enable the PSF to make crucial security advances to CPython and the Python Package Index (PyPI) benefiting all users, and it will also sustain the foundation’s core work supporting the Python language, ecosystem, and global community.

**Innovating open source security** Anthropic’s funds will enable the PSF to make progress on our security roadmap, including work designed to protect millions of PyPI users from attempted supply-chain attacks. Planned projects include creating new tools for automated proactive review of all packages uploaded to PyPI, improving on the current process of reactive-only review. We intend to create a new dataset of known malware that will allow us to design these novel tools, relying on capability analysis. One of the advantages of this project is that we expect the outputs we develop to be transferable to all open source package repositories. As a result, this work has the potential to ultimately improve security across multiple open source ecosystems, starting with the Python ecosystem.  
This work will build on [PSF Security Developer in Residence Seth Larson](https://sethmlarson.dev/)’s security roadmap with contributions from [PyPI Safety and Security Engineer Mike Fiedler](https://www.miketheman.net/), both roles generously funded by [Alpha-Omega](https://alpha-omega.dev/). **Sustaining the Python language, ecosystem, and community** Anthropic’s support will also go towards the PSF’s core work, including the Developer in Residence program driving contributions to CPython, community support through grants and other programs, running core infrastructure such as PyPI, and more. We couldn’t be more grateful for Anthropic’s remarkable support, and we hope you will join us in thanking them for their investment in the PSF and the Python community.
