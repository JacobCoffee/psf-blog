**On December 19, the Python Software Foundation’s board voted to present Antoine Pitrou with a Community Service Award for the fourth quarter of 2012. Antoine has been a prolific CPython contributor throughout his more than five years of work, with his efforts reaching many areas of the code. His [improvements to CPython’s global interpreter lock](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2009-October/093321.html), or GIL, in the fall of 2009 caught a lot of attention around the web. He was also a major contributor to Python 3’s I/O system for the 3.0 release, and his recent work on [PEP 3151](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3151/) to rework the OS and IO exception hierarchy was shipped in the 3.3 release. His activity extends throughout the codebase and development process, where he’s active in bug triage and spends time in IRC. On top of the over 3000 commits made by Antoine since gaining access in June 2008, making him the seventh most active committer, he has been involved in several parts of the python.org infrastructure, including CPython’s [buildbot](http://www.python.org/dev/buildbot/) system. The Python Software Foundation and Python community thanks Antoine for his consistent efforts and excellent contributions!**
