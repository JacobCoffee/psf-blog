Facundo Batista posted a report on [the Santa Fe Python Day](http://www.python-santafe.com.ar/), held on Saturday June 9 2007. The PSF was one of the conference sponsors. $500 were donated. Facundo writes:

> It was very successful. Around +300 people assisted, and there were a lot of interesting talks (two introductory talks, Turbogears, PyWeek, Zope 3, security, creating 3D games, Plone, automatic security testings, concurrency, and programming the OLPC).
