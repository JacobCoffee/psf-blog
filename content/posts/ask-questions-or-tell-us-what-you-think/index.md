Greetings, Pythonistas- thank you so much for supporting the work of the Python Software Foundation (PSF) and the Python community! The current PSF Board has decided to invest more in connecting and serving the global Python community by establishing a forum to have regular conversations. The [board members of the PSF](https://www.python.org/psf/board/) with the support of [PSF staff](https://www.python.org/psf/records/staff/) are excited to introduce monthly PSF Board Office Hours on the [PSF Discord](https://discord.gg/4Hm36PPgpG). The Office Hours will be sessions where you can share with us how we can help your community, express your perspectives, and provide feedback for the PSF.

## What are the PSF Board Office Hours?

Similar to the [PSF Grants Program Office Hours](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/02/introducing-psf-grants-office-hours.html) where PSF staff members help to answer questions regarding the [PSF Grants Program](https://www.python.org/psf/grants/), during the PSF Board Office Hours you can participate in a **text-based live chat** with PSF Board Directors. This is a chance to connect, share, and collaborate with the PSF Board and staff to improve our community together. Occasionally, we will have dedicated topics such as PyCon US and the PSF Board Elections for the office hour sessions. Here is some of the work that we collaborate with staff and volunteers on:  

-   Promotion and outreach for the Python programming language
-   Supporting local Python communities
-   Organizing [PyCon US](https://us.pycon.org/)
-   Diversity and Inclusion in our community
-   Support handling of Code of Conduct within our communities
-   Support regional Python communities via the [PSF Grants Program](https://www.python.org/psf/grants/)
-   Furthering the [mission of the PSF](https://www.python.org/psf/mission/)

  
Unless we have a dedicated topic for a session, you are not limited to talking with us about the above topics, although the discussions should be focused on Python, the PSF, and our community. If you think there’s something we can help with or we should know, we welcome you to come and talk to us!

## Joining the office hours

The office hour sessions will take place on the PSF Discord server in the #psf-board channel.

Make sure to [check what time these sessions are for you locally](https://time.is/) so you don't miss out! Sessions after August 13th, 2025, will be announced in the future.  

## Who will be at the office hours?

Some of the board members of the PSF will be attending each office hour, as well as members of the PSF Staff. The [list of the PSF Board Directors](https://www.python.org/psf/board/) can be found on our website. We are passionate Python community members who are happy to listen, help, and provide support to you. We are happy to follow up with you if there are any issues we cannot address immediately during the office hour sessions. As always, you can email us at psf-board@python.org with inquiries, feedback, or comments at any time.
