When we first announced [our trademark issues](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2013/02/python-trademark-at-risk-in-europe-we.html) yesterday, we immediately and continually received a great outpouring of support from our community. The number of supporting emails in our inbox is tremendous, and the financial support has been incredible. For this, we thank all of you. However, it has come to our attention that the organization with which we are currently involved in a trademark dispute has been receiving messages from our community members, including threats. We ask that no matter who you support in this matter, that you remain civil in your communications and actions. It is important that we maintain the positive and friendly atmosphere that Python is known for regardless of the situation at hand.
