Following discussions at EuroPython there has been some talk about the possibility of introducing associate memberships. At present nobody is really clear exactly what such a package would comprise, but it's likely that there'd be a mailing list, a quarterly (printed, snail-mailed) newsletter and perhaps other benefits.

Current evidence is that many people would like to support Python and the Foundation's mission by paying for such an associate membership, and it could also be seen as a "starter grade" for those with ambitions to eventually become full members.

What do you think a PSF Associate Membership should provide, and what should the obligations of membership be (if any)?
