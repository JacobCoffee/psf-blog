Congratulations to everyone who won a seat on the PSF Board! We’re so excited to work with you. New and returning Board Directors will start their three year terms this month at the next PSF board meeting. Thanks to everyone else who ran this year and added their voice to the conversation about the future of the Python community. It was a tough race with many amazing candidates.

Thanks to everyone who voted and helped us spread the word! We really appreciate that so many of you took the time to participate in our elections this year. By the numbers, we sent ballots to 1,459 voting PSF members who then chose among 26 nominees. By the end 578 votes were cast, well over the one third required for quorum. While the board elections are over, there are lots of other ways to get involved with the Python community. Here are [a few things](https://www.python.org/psf/get-involved/) you can get started with or you could consider serving with one of our [working groups](https://www.python.org/psf/committees/). If you want to start participating on the technical side of things, you might want to [check out our forum](https://discuss.python.org/). Next year’s board elections will happen at approximately the same time in 2023. If you want to make sure you are notified via email, join the [psf-vote](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/psf-vote) mailing list.
