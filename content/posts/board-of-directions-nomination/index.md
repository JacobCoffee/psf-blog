Unfortunately, the Python Wiki has experienced some spamming and vandalism lately. This may mean that editing the Wiki, including the Directors nomination page may take a little extra work until we get things sorted out. This is described on the [Front Page](https://wiki.python.org/moin/FrontPage#use):  

> Since spamming and vandalism on this wiki has reached a level that is starting to require daily intervention, new users are no longer allowed to edit pages.  
> If you want to edit a page and have just signed up, or you find that you can no longer edit a page that you could edit before, please write to the [pydotorg-www](mailto:pydotorg-www@python.org) mailing list, stating your account name and your intended edits and we'll add you to the *EditorsGroup*.  
> Sorry for the inconvenience, but we want to keep this wiki a useful tool for the community, while at the same time need to prevent wiki admin burnout effects.

Bear with us. We will continue balancing making the Wiki usable with also making it resistant to harmful changes by unregistered or malicious users. Our great thanks go out to Marc-André Lemburg and the PyDotOrg team who rescued an almost completely vandalized Wiki using imperfect backups, and heroic efforts, back in 2013.
