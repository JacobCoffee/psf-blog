The site for PyCon 2014 and 2015 has not been set, yet. If you want your city to be considered, attend the Site Selection Meeting in the **Dunwoody room** at PyCon 2011 during the **Sunday lunch break**. Tell us why *your* city should be the next host of the premier Python conference in North America.
