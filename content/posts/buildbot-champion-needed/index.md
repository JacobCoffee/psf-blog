The Python buildbots have been switched off. The reason for this is that there is nobody to manage them, and configuration changes would be required (along with continuous management) for the buildbots to be restarted.

If you'd like to help Python's continuous integration process, please drop an email to pydotorg at python dot org.

EDIT: the buildbots referred to are the community buildbots used to run tests for specific projects. The primary need is for people to donate, and actively manage, build slaves.
