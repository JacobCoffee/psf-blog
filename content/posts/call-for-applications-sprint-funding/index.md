The PSF Sprints Committee has sent out a call for applications from groups who want funding to host sprints on Python-related development work.

#### Sprints Committee

The Sprints Committee was [established in June 2010](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2010/06/psf-sponsored-sprints.html) to encourage and assist groups to come together to work on Python-related projects. The committee has successfully funded a number of sprints since it was created, and the PSF Board of Directors has recently set aside additional funding to be used for sprinting during the upcoming year.

#### Sprint Topics

Sprints on any topic related to Python may qualify for a grant. Groups can work on any of the interpreters (CPython, PyPy, Jython, IronPython, etc.), modules from the standard library, third-party libraries, development tools, or anything else affecting the community.

Sponsored sprints have covered topics including porting Genshi to Python 3, improvements to packaging as part of the Distribute/distutils project, and most recently, the [PyPy winter sprint](http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2011/02/pypy-winter-sprint-report.html) in Switzerland. Check out the [sprints blog](http://pythonsprints.com/) for more details.

#### Assistance

The Sprints Committee has prepared guides for [sprinting on Python core](http://docs.pythonsprints.com/core_development/) and [porting to Python 3](http://docs.pythonsprints.com/python3_porting/) to help make your event successful. In addition to organizational support, the committee can also offer financial assistance in the form of grants.

Any sprint group can apply for a grant from to cover expenses directly related to a sprint event. That includes buying meals, renting meeting space, and other reasonable expenses. The maximum grant for an event is US$300.

If your group is interested in hosting a sprint, check out the full details of the [call for applications](http://www.pythonsprints.com/cfa/) at and contact the Sprints Committee at [sprints@python.org](mailto:sprints@python.org).
