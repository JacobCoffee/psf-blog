The period to submit proposals for [PyCon 2010](http://us.pycon.org/2010/) in Atlanta, Georgia (USA) is now open and will close on October 18. Tutorials are 3-hour long classes on a specific Python technique, package or technology and are taught by members of the Python community. If you have knowledge in a particular topic and would like to be considered to teach a class we invite you to submit a proposal outlining the material you would like to cover. Once we receive your proposal, we will "score" it based on content and then select 24 classes (subject to change) for presentation.

Class instructors will be paid $1000.00 per class. If a class has more than one teacher, the fee will be split between them.

Interested? Click on over to the [Tutorial Proposal Page](http://us.pycon.org/2010/tutorials/proposals/) to see more details, examples of classes that have been requested in the past (though you are free to submit a proposal on anything Python), an example proposal and an empty template to help you prepare your own proposal. Once complete, email your proposal to pycon-tutorials@python.orgso we can get it out to the evaluation committee and get you on your way to being a PyCon instructor.

Questions? You can contact us at the PyCon Email List (pycon-tutorials@python.org) and we will get back with you.

We look forward to hearing from you!

Greg Lindstrom, Tutorial Coordinator for PyCon 2010 (Atlanta)
