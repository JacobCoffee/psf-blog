If your Python user group, conference, or major project has a Twitter account, send a message to [@ThePSF](http://twitter.com/ThePSF) so we can follow you and help spread your news.

**Updated**: We want to follow your *user group* on twitter. There are just too many individuals to make following one at a time realistic. Sorry for the confusion!
