TLDR; the Python Software Foundation needs the support of companies that use and rely on Python and [our sponsorship applications are open](https://www.python.org/sponsors/application/)! Read on for more details: The [PSF](http://python.org/psf) is the charity behind the Python programming language, supporting the health, security, and growth of the language and its community. We rely on sponsorships, memberships, and donations to keep our foundation and the Python ecosystem running strong, and we need your help to connect with potential supporters. Here are just some of the ways we support the Python community:  

-   **Run a Developer-in-Residence program** of 5 individuals focused on vital areas of work like CPython, PyPI, and security.
-   **[Maintain critical services](https://www.python.org/psf-landing/)** like python.org, PyPI, Python documentation, and more.
-   **[Produce PyCon US](https://us.pycon.org)**, an event that brings both the community and organizations together to build, learn, grow together, and make connections.
-   **[Award grants](https://www.python.org/psf/grants/)** to regional PyCons, workshops, and Python initiatives across the globe, that have impacted approximately 30,000 Pythonistas in 2024 so far.
-   [**Support 20 Fiscal Sponsoree** **organizations**](https://www.python.org/psf/fiscal-sponsorees/) like PyLadies and PyPA with back office administration so that they can focus on what they do best: building Python and its community.

If you want to learn more about what we do, check out our [2022](https://www.python.org/psf/annual-report/2022/) and [2023](https://www.python.org/psf/annual-report/2023/) Annual Impact Reports. With additional sponsors, we can sustain these efforts and do even more! **So, what can you do to help us gain sponsors?**  
**Step 1)** If your company is using Python to build its products and services, check to see if they sponsor the PSF on our [Sponsors page](https://www.python.org/psf/sponsors/).  
**Step 2)** If not, reach out to your organization's internal decision-makers and impress on them just how important it is for us to power the future of Python together, and send them our [sponsor prospectus](https://www.python.org/sponsors/application/). (Or, just send them this post!)  
**Step 3)** Point out the various benefits they will receive from sponsoring the PSF. Mention that [PyCon US 2025](https://us.pycon.org/2025/) is coming up, where they can connect with the community, recruit, and understand the current direction of the Python language!  
**Step 4)** Remind them to reach out to sponsors@python.org if they have any questions, or would like a walk-through of our sponsorship program. The PSF sends a huge thanks to every organization that already sponsors us; we couldn’t do this without you. We are also so grateful for the individuals who serve and volunteer with the Board, workgroups, and PyCon US. And for those community members who advocate for what we do, and for all the reposts, the likes, the shares in your #chatplatformofchoice channels, and the shout outs at your regional events. (We are running our [end-of-year fundraiser to #PowerPython](https://www.python.org/psf/donations/2024-q4-drive/), so consider a [donation](https://psfmember.org/civicrm/contribute/transact/?reset=1&id=2) or [PSF membership](https://www.python.org/psf/membership/), and keep hitting those like and repost buttons on our social posts!) **We all depend on this wonderful language and the people who comprise it, and we all need to pitch in to continue building, growing, and doing amazing things with Python. We’re so incredibly grateful to be in community with you!**
