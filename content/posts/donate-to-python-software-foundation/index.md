Please consider including the Python Software Foundation (PSF) in your year-end charitable giving.

Your donation will help us protect the open source status of Python. The PSF also provides the financial backing that makes PyCon possible, donates to other Python conferences around the world, and funds grants and special projects in the Python community.

For details of our activities, please see [the PSF pages on the Python website](http://www.python.org/psf/).

[You can donate here](http://www.python.org/psf/donations/)

Donations from individuals are tax deductible in the US and may be tax deductible in other countries, or as a business expense. We take credit cards, checks, wire transfers, and PayPal.

Sponsorship Opportunities for Businesses

Businesses invested in Python can also [become a sponsor member](http://www.python.org/psf/sponsorship/) of the PSF.

Or [become a sponsor of PyCon 2008](http://us.pycon.org/2008/sponsors/), a great way to gain exposure for your business or find talented Python programmers to hire.

Thanks!
