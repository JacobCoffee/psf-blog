I have also posted the old-style HTML to my starship.python.net account so that
you get the pretty colors on action items: [http://python.net/~goodger/tmp/minutes-2006-02-14.html](http://python.net/%7Egoodger/tmp/minutes-2006-02-14.html)
Adding support for colored action items to the new python.org stylesheet is on my to-do list.

Coming soon: minutes of the PSF Members Meeting at PyCon 2006, and minutes of the board meeting at PyCon.

— David Goodger, PSF Secretary
