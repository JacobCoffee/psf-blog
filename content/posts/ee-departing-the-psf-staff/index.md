This week will be my last as the Director of Infrastructure at the Python Software Foundation and my last week as a staff member. Supporting the mission of this organization with my labor has been unbelievable in retrospect and I am filled with gratitude to every member of this community, volunteer, sponsor, board member, and staff member of this organization who have worked alongside me and entrusted me with root@python.org for all this time.

  

But, it is time for me to do something new. I don’t believe there would ever be a perfect time for this transition, but I do believe that now is one of the best. The PSF has built out a team that shares the responsibilities I carried across our technical infrastructure, the maintenance and support of PyPI, relationships with our in-kind sponsors, and the facilitation of PyCon US. I’m also not “burnt-out” or worse, I knew that one day I would move on “dead or alive” and it is so good to feel alive in this decision, literally and figuratively.

  

> *“The PSF and the Python community are very lucky to have had Ee at the helm for so many years. Ee’s approach to our technical needs has been responsive and resilient as Python, PyPI, PSF staff and the community have all grown, and their dedication to the community has been unmatched and unwavering. Ee is leaving the PSF in fantastic shape, and I know I join the rest of the staff in wishing them all the best as they move on to their next endeavor.”*

> \- Deb Nicholson, Executive Director

  

The health and wellbeing of the PSF and the Python community is of utmost importance to me, and was paramount as I made decisions around this transition. Given that, I am grateful to be able to commit 20% of my time over the next six months to the PSF to provide support and continuity. Over the past few weeks we’ve been working internally to set things up for success, and I look forward to meeting the new staff and what they accomplish with the team at the PSF!

  

My participation in the Python community and contributions to the infrastructure began long before my role as a staff member. As I transition out of participating as PSF staff I look forward to continuing to participate in and contribute to this community as a volunteer, as long as I am lucky enough to have the chance.
