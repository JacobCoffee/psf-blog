REYKJAVIK, Iceland, 17 May 2005: Two Python Software Foundation directors (Steve Holden, Tim Peters) and a former director (Fredrik Lundh) are among a group of eighteen Python developers traveling to Iceland this weekend to start a six-day meeting dubbed the "Need for Speed" sprint. Participants are coordinating through [the NeedForSpeed wiki page](http://wiki.python.org/moin/NeedForSpeed) in the Python wiki.

The sprint is sponsored by [EWT, LLC](http://www.ewtcareers.com/) of Beverly Hills, CA, with local support from Icelandic gaming company [CCP](http://www.ccpgames.com/). The technical goals are improvements to Python's performance, but this event is also an experiment in collaboration between the open source and the commercial worlds.
