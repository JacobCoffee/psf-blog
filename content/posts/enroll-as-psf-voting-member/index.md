"Membership has its privileges!" Since the new PSF bylaws were adopted in 2013, there have been several new membership categories that allow for voting rights. Unfortunately it has taken some time for the PSF to devise a form to allow members to report their eligibility for those categories. We apologize, but here it is at last: [Voting Membership](http://goo.gl/XBST1o). We know that many of you have made valuable contributions to the language and the PSF, so we hope that you will take the next step and claim your right to vote. Please review the membership criteria at [Membership Bylaws](https://www.python.org/psf/bylaws/). And for those of you who are not yet PSF members, we encourage you to join under the Basic Membership category. All it takes is to sign up here: [PSF Membership](https://www.python.org/users/membership/). Thanks to Director David Mertz for the creation of the form and to Directors Marc-André Lemburg and Nick Coghlan for their assistance. Addendum: Just to clarify, if you are already a voting member (e.g., as a PSF Fellow), there is no need to do anything more. This new form is for Basic Members who do not as yet have voting rights but who qualify according to the criteria.
