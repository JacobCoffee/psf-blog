I am happy to announce that on June 1, 2018, Ee Durbin joined the Python Software Foundation team as the Director of Infrastructure. [![](./image-1.jpg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi15aBNYDKzZsrotHzBV5Yvf3f7kcE5Y1s8xM95JavsQshRQ6vbdm8OLCdXGkFK4WSozHIxSFVSRq0wg988o2kshr-6fK2uQ4Lhl4-ehJIvE88ofNK1KKV2qEyk95COmlzAX7c/s1600/IMG_3600.jpg) Ee is a long time volunteer contributor to the PSF's Infrastructure Work Group, PyPI, and most recently PyCon US. Through their past experiences, Ee has gained the insight needed to best guide the PSF forward. Ee's responsibilities in the role will include:  

-   evaluating and strengthening internal systems
-   supporting and improving community infrastructure
-   outreach and mentorship for our volunteers that contribute to the PSF's infrastructure
-   developing programs that benefit the Python community world wide

  
Ee is very excited to take our infrastructure to the next level and through that better support our community. The PSF Staff and Directors are thrilled to have Ee on board. Prior to this, the role was held by Mark Mangoba as a part-time position. We thank Mark for his dedication to the PSF for the last two years as our IT Manager. We wish him the best in his future endeavors. If you have any questions or comments, please [email me](mailto:ewa@python.org). Note: Edited 2022-05-23 to reflect Ee's chosen name
