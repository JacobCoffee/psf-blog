The PSF Board has offered a $2,000 grant to the organizers of [EuroPython](http://www.europython.eu/) 2010 to fund sprints and the travel expenses of selected sepakers who could not otherwise attend the conference.

#### Conference Details

EuroPython will be held July 19-22 in Birmingham, UK. As [previously mentioned](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2010/06/members-meeting-at-europython-2010.html), this year's conference marks the first time a PSF members' meeting will be held outside of the United States.

See the [EuroPython](http://www.europython.eu/) web site for more details, including the list of confirmed speakers and conference schedule.
