Only now have I been able to make the time to record the recipients of the final PSF Community Service Awards of 2009. I hope the recipients will accept my apologies for the lateness of this announcement. Catherine Devlin received her award for her long-term contributions to PyCon, the organization of the first two PyOhio regional conferences, for promoting diversity in the Python community and for education efforts. Facundo Batista's award came for organizing PyCon Argentina and the Argentinian Python community as well as contributions to the standard library and work in translating the Python documentation. The PSF's thanks go to both these people (both, as it happens, PSF members though this is not a pre-requisite to be honored).
