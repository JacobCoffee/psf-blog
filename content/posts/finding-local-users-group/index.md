Do you belong to a local or regional Python users' group? Is your group included in the [list on the Python.org wiki](http://wiki.python.org/moin/LocalUserGroups)? Sign your group up today so new members can find you!

Add your name to the appropriate geographic section, and include a link to your home page so prospective members will know where to go to find more details. If your group does not have a web site, blog, or mailing list to link to, just include the relevant details right on the wiki page (where do you meet? when?).
