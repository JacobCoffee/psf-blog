The PSF Board has offered a grant of $750 to the organizers of the [PyCon Poland 2010](http://pl.pycon.org/2010) conference.

#### Conference Details

PyCon Poland 2010 will take place from October 8 to 10, which is a little earlier than the previous conference. The conference will be held at the Centre for Leisure-Training "Gwarek" in Ustron Jaszowiec in Cieszyn Silesia, the same location as last year.

The [conference website](http://pl.pycon.org/2010) mentions a planned hot grill, barbecue on Saturday 9th, and also names the possibility to burn off those calories in the gym or sauna.

Presentation topics include programming Python and Ajax, optimization and profiling, physics, math, administrative tasks, GPU programming, and more.

See the [conference website](http://pl.pycon.org/2010) web site for more details about the conference.
