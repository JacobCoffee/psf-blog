At the July Board meeting of the PSF Board of Directors, [PSF Community Awards](http://www.python.org/community/awards/psf-awards/) were awarded to Georg Brandl and Brett Cannon.

Georg has been an enthusiastic contributor to the core for several years, and a while ago stunned the Python development world by building [the Sphinx documentation system](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/) as an alternative to the LaTeX-based system we had been using previously, and converting [the Python documentation](http://docs.python.org/dev/) to use it.

Brett has also been an active core developer for many years, but was nominated for his infrastructure work in migrating [the Python bug-tracking system](http://bugs.python.org/) off of SourceForge to our own Roundup instance, and for his efforts keeping [the Python developer introduction](http://www.python.org/dev/intro/) updated.

Georg and Brett richly deserve recognition for their contributions. Congratulations to Brett and Georg, and thanks for all your hard work!
