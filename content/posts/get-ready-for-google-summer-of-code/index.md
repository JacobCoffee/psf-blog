Python project contributors and student enthusiasts, mark your calendars: Google Summer of Code applications open soon! [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/) is an annual, global program pairing student developers with mentors in open source projects for paid summer internships. You can learn more about this year's Google Summer of Code [here](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2013).  

# Python projects

Python serves as an umbrella organization for around a dozen open source Python projects each year. Last year Python core, mailman, Pandas, PyGame, Pylons, PySide, PySoy, scikit-learn, statsmodels, Tryton, and Twisted participated. If your Python project is interested in participating in Google Summer of Code under the Python umbrella, it's time to start preparing your applications:  

1.  Tell the Python Google Summer of Code coordinators that your project wants to participate! Follow the [instructions on the Python wiki](http://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode/2013).
2.  Review [last year's projects and their idea pages](http://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode/2012).
3.  Start outlining candidate student projects. Good student projects are detailed, can be broken down into step-by-step goals, and are realistic in scope and difficulty for a 3-month student intern.
4.  Start gathering mentors. We recommend that each student have both a primary and backup mentor.

## Important deadlines

-   **March 18**: Mentoring organizations can begin submitting applications to Google.
-   **March 29**: Mentoring organization application deadline.

# Students

Google Summer of Code is a paid summer internship program for college/university students who will be 18 years of age or older on May 27, 2013. Participating in Google Summer of Code is a great way to develop real-world software engineering skills while giving back to an open source Python project you love. Read more about eligibility in the [FAQ](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2013/help_page). If you are interested in participating in Google Summer of Code under the Python umbrella, it's time to start exploring potential projects and practicing the tools of open source development:  

1.  Read the [Python Google Summer of Code guidelines](http://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode/2013).
2.  [Review last year's projects and their idea pages](http://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode/2012).
3.  Start practicing the tools of open source development, including:  
    -   IRC
    -   a revision control system like git or svn
    -   the diff and patch utilities
    -   bug trackers

If you've never used some of these tools before, don't worry! You have plenty of time to practice. A good resource for getting familiar with these tools is the [OpenHatch training missions](http://openhatch.org/missions/).

## Important deadlines

-   **April 8**: List of accepted mentoring organizations published on theGoogle Summer of Code 2013 site.
-   **April 9 - 21**: Student applicants discuss application ideas with mentoring organizations.
-   **April 22**: Student application period opens.
-   **May 3**: Student application deadline.

Note that the best way to boost your chances of being accepted for Google Summer of Code is to start contributing to a project **before** you apply. If you have questions about how to get started or just want some friendly encouragement, visit the OpenHatch project and [say hello](https://openhatch.org/wiki/Contact).
