#### Comments from grant recipients:

"The PSF Fiscal Sponsorship allows us to focus on building community, while they handle our non-profit status, accounting, and back office." - Eric Holscher, PyCascades Conference Organizer "The PSF was North Bay Python's first sponsor. Their early financial support for our mission helped kickstart what has become one of the most well-regarded regional conferences in our community." - Christopher Neugebauer, Conference Organizer "Without the support of the PSF, our events would not have been possible. Many of our attendees are now working or interning as Python or Django Developers." - Jeel Mehta, Django Girls Bhavnagar, India Conference Volunteer "The PSF grant allowed us to run an all day workshop for women. More organizations should apply for a PSF grant so they can enable and motivate more people, especially minorities, to start their great journey into programming." - Women in Technology, Peru
