Greetings Readers, I apologize for the hiatus I’ve taken recently from writing this blog -- other commitments temporarily got in the way. But during this time the PSF has been hard at work, and I intend to catch you up on their activities in the next few posts. First of all, the Community Service Awards have been given out for both the second and third quarters of 2015. I am extremely happy to announce that the second quarter award went to our good friend, Nicholas Tollervey, for his excellent work in education and outreach. You can read more about Nick in a recent previous post to this blog ([Tollervey](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/06/nicholas-tollervey-and-python-in.html)), so I’ll forgo saying more about him here, other than congratulations, and will turn to telling you about our third quarter award recipients.

> RESOLVED, that the Python Software Foundation award the 2015 3rd Quarter Community Service Award to Victor Stinner and Serhiy Storchaka ([PSF CSA](https://www.python.org/community/awards/psf-awards/)).

Both Stinner and Storchaka are extremely active Python core developers. In the past three years, Serhiy has contributed well over 2000 commits, while Victor comes in a close second with almost 2000. Their hard work and dedication have helped increase Python’s vitality, relevance, and amazing growth -- a fact that the PSF wishes to recognize with this award. In addition, Serhiy Storchaka is active on the Python tracker, taking the time to help other contributors by reviewing and committing their patches. Victor Stinner’s work additionally includes 20 PEPs (see [PEPs](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/)) as well as active participation in the Python community. You can view his PyCon 2014 talk [here](http://www.pyvideo.org/speaker/180/victor-stinner). He is also one of the developers of the [tulip/asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) project which provides asynchronous I/O support to Python. It was Victor who ported tulip/asyncio to Python 2; its usefulness has resulted in its recently being included as part of the Python 3.4 standard library.

Please join me in congratulating our latest CSA recipients and in thanking them for their important work. *I would love to hear from readers. Please send feedback, comments, or blog ideas to me at [msushi@gnosis.cx](mailto:msushi@gnosis.cx).*
