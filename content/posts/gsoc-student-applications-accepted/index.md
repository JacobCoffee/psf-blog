#### Statistics

This has been a growth year for the PSF's involvement in GSoC. We have had the largest group of applicants and mentors since we began participating in the program, up about 10% from last year. Students submitted 89 applications, both for core Python development work and for one of the projects being sponsored by the PSF. The community has provided 72 mentors to help the students.

#### Increasing Diversity

The PSF is committed to increasing the diversity of the Python community. One way we have been working toward that goal is by encouraging women and other minorities to apply to participate in GSoC through one of the PSF-sponsored projects. This year, three of the 36 accepted applications are from women. That is an improvement over past years, but we still have work to do to raise the participation rate further.

#### What Next?

The GSoC program is now in the [Community Bonding Period](http://googlesummerofcode.blogspot.com/2007/04/so-what-is-this-community-bonding-all.html). Community members should watch for messages from the student participants on mailing lists and in other forums, and take the opportunity to get to know them. This is also a good time to introduce them to the development tools and processes, and answer questions about how patches are reviewed and approved or how best to communicate with other team members.

For more details about the schedule, see the [GSoC timeline](http://socghop.appspot.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2011/timeline) on the project web site.
