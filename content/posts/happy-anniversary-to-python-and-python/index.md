-   diversity and inclusion efforts
-   establishing and enforcing a code of conduct for our community
-   making PyCon more accessible
-   improving the services we provide to the community
-   increasing our support of developers and volunteers
-   supporting Python conferences, workshops, and other events around the world.

As we celebrate the PSF’s 20th and Python’s 30th anniversaries, we want to welcome everyone to become a PSF member. It’s important to us to have a membership that reflects our community. We want our community to be more diverse: whoever you are, and whatever your background, we welcome you. We are working to support a community that is based on mutual respect, acceptance, and encouragement.

Everyone who uses and supports Python is invited to join us at any of the following membership levels:

### Basic Member - it’s free!

Being part of the PSF means being part of the Python community. In 2014, we changed the bylaws to make the PSF an open membership organization, so that everyone who uses and supports Python can join. You can sign up as a basic member [here](https://www.python.org/accounts/login/?next=/users/membership/).

### Supporting Member - $99/year

Supporting members make an annual donation to the PSF to sustain the Foundation and support the Python community. They are eligible to vote for candidates for the PSF Board of Directors, changes in the PSF bylaws, and other matters related to the foundation. To become a Supporting member, follow the instructions [here](https://www.psfmember.org/).

### Managing Member

Managing members are people who dedicate at least five hours per month working to support the Python ecosystem - by organizing Python events, managing or contributing to PSF projects, running infrastructure, participating in one of the PSF's working groups etc. For details on signing up as a contributing member, refer to [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfwWBGkzvkWDZrxW3up_M_B7qgt1IWZlx9KJ0ucLA5WJP1vfA/viewform).

Contributing members are people who dedicate at least five hours per month working on projects that advance the mission of the PSF, where the work relates to the creation or maintenance of open source software available to the public at no charge.

## Help us celebrate and spread the word!

We’d love to hear your stories about what being part of the Python community means to you. Post a picture or a memory with our hashtag (#psfanniversary) and we’ll retweet.

We at the PSF want to thank everyone in our community for all that you do. Your support is what makes Python and its community so extraordinary.
