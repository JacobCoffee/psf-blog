To assist those wanting to migrate their code to Python 3.0 the developers have just [announced](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2008-December/083951.html) the creation of the [Python-porting](http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-porting) mailing list. Signing up for the list is a good way to tap in to the advice of the core developers, so it's probably a good list even if you only want to lurk to begin with.

Remember that it may take a while for all your project's dependencies to migrate to the new environment, but it's available now, so fill your boots!
