Vern Ceder's Canterbury High School students are learning to program in Python by making robots play music, find objects in the room, and perform other challenging tasks. The local paper, [The Fort Wayne Journal Gazette](http://www.jg.net/), wrote [a story about the class](http://www.jg.net/article/20101206/LOCAL04/312069949) earlier this month, and Vern blogs about how he arranged that on the [Learn Python blog](http://learnpython.wordpress.com/2010/12/12/python-in-the-news/) for the benefit of other members of the community with similar projects.

Congratulations to the students at Canterbury High, and keep up the good work!
