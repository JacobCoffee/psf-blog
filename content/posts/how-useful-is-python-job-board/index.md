A service that the PSF has run for a very long time now is the [Python Job Board](http://www.python.org/community/jobs/). This allows any potential employer with a requirement for Python skills to post a free advertisement. The service is free because it is primarily intended to benefit Python community members. Employers are encouraged, but not required, to contribute to the Foundation.

So what I'd like to know is this: how useful is that service? If you have ever found the Job Board helpful, as either employee or employer, or even just to keep an eye on the Python employment market, please post a brief comment here letting us know what the Board did for you.

Employers and agents: please [read this page](http://www.python.org/community/jobs/howto/) before submitting jobs: the Board is run by volunteers, and you can make their task easier.
