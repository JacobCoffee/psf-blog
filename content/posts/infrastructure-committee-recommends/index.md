Brett Cannon, chair of the infrastructure commitee, has posted [the committee's recommendation](http://sayspy.blogspot.com/2006/10/psf-infrastructure-committee.html) for a new bug tracker.

The PSF thanks everyone who set up a bug tracker and performed a trial import of Python's bug database -- a considerable amount of effort on their part.
