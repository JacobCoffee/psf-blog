The Python Software Foundation (PSF) is excited to announce the introduction of the [PSF Community Partner Program](https://www.python.org/psf/community-partners/). This new program is designed as an “in-kind” way for us to support Python events and initiatives with non-financial assistance through the use of the PSF logo and name, as well as promotional support via sharing qualified posts on PSF official social media accounts. The PSF looks forward to supporting Python community events and initiatives through this new program! The introduction of the PSF Community Partner Program grew out of our desire to find alternative ways to support the community during the [pause of our Grants Program](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/08/the-psf-has-paused-our-grants-program.html) (read more about the resulting process below). Even so, we intend to continue offering this in-kind support program after the Grants Program reopens. Our big picture hope is that, over the long term, some community events and initiatives will continue to partner with the PSF while being financially dependent on sponsors and individual donors alone. The PSF is also working on the future of our Grants Program, including when and how we can reopen it in a way that ensures the program’s long-term sustainability while balancing the needs of the Python community. In light of the truly staggering outpouring of support from our community during the 2025 year-end fundraiser, we are now in a stronger position to reopen the Grants Program and are eager to give back in a thoughtful and sustainable way. More updates to come! As with the rollout of any new program, we anticipate small adjustments will need to be made for processes to flow smoothly and to ensure the program serves the Python community well. The PSF welcomes your comments, feedback, and suggestions regarding the new Community Partner Program on [the corresponding Discuss thread](https://discuss.python.org/t/introducing-the-psf-community-partner-program-for-python-events-initiatives/106095). We also invite you to join our upcoming [PSF Board](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/10/a-new-psf-board-another-year-of-psf.html) or [Grants Program Office Hour](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/02/introducing-psf-grants-office-hours.html) sessions to talk with the PSF Board and Staff synchronously. If you wish to send your feedback privately, please email grants@python.org.

## How the program will work

The PSF Board delegated authority to the Grants Work Group (GWG) to review, approve, and deny applications for the Community Partner Program. Similar to the PSF Grants Program, the PSF must ensure that applicants meet certain criteria before being approved as a Community Partner. To qualify, an event or initiative must:  

-   Demonstrate a positive impact on the Python community
-   Be Python-specific or primarily Python-related
-   Have an established web presence, such as a dedicated website, Meetup page, or Luma page
-   Have an enforceable Code of Conduct with clear reporting mechanisms in place
-   Acknowledge and agree to the defined bounds of the Community Partner title as outlined in the application form

The PSF Community Partner application process begins with a [one-page form](https://forms.gle/6HyvLDpHEtGSpfK97) designed to collect the information needed for review by the GWG. The form gathers:  

-   Basic applicant details
-   Information about the event or initiative
-   Required acknowledgements related to trademark usage and an enforceable Code of Conduct
-   A couple questions to better understand the event or initiative, support evaluation, or help the PSF gather relevant metrics

Applicants are asked to submit their application at least six weeks before their event or initiative, with first-time applicants encouraged to apply eight weeks in advance. Applications may be submitted up to six months ahead of time, allowing the PSF to plan and provide timely promotional support. Once submitted, applications undergo an initial pre-review by PSF staff, who may follow up with clarifying questions as needed. The application will then be reviewed by the GWG, with consultation from the PSF Board in some cases and additional follow-up questions when necessary.

Decisions will be communicated via the email address provided in the application. Accepted Community Partners will receive guidance on PSF logo usage, social media re-sharing, and an invitation to provide an optional report.  

## How the program took shape

Upon the [pause of the PSF Grants Program](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/08/the-psf-has-paused-our-grants-program.html), the PSF Board and Staff set out to understand how we can continue to support Python events and initiatives for the duration of the program's pause. We dedicated Board and Grants Office Hour sessions, gathered input on a Discuss thread, tracked our social media replies to the pause announcement, and talked with community members one-on-one to get a picture of the various needs of our community. From there, PSF Staff compiled the feedback to identify the common threads to weave them together into action. One of the most common themes uncovered is that while the financial assistance offered by our grants is incredibly valuable, the use of the PSF name that comes with grants also provides a strong signal of community trust–an official “stamp of approval”. This stamp of approval empowers Python events and initiatives to approach potential sponsors and is useful as a point of leverage and proof of trustworthiness to convince sponsors to sign on. The next most common theme was that Python events and initiatives would greatly benefit from promotional support. This is a common benefit of “in-kind” partnerships and was a natural addition to the new PSF Community Partner Program. It’s also a bit of a tricky line for the PSF to navigate–as a 501(c)(3) non-profit based in the USA, we cannot raise funds for other organizations. That means we are implementing guidelines for what the PSF can and cannot promote to remain compliant with the requirements of the US federal tax code. After identifying both of these recurring themes, PSF Staff put together a program proposal with input from the GWG and PSF Board. The process from there included review periods for the PSF Board, Staff, and GWG, integrating feedback, two votes from the PSF Board, and PSF Staff work on setting up processes and documentation.
