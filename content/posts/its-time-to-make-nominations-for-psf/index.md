This year’s Board Election Nomination period opens tomorrow and closes on June 25th. Who runs for the board? People who care about the Python community, who want to see it flourish and grow, and also have a few hours a month to attend regular meetings, serve on committees, participate in conversations, and promote the Python community. Check out our [Life as Python Software Foundation Director video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLKj6FaQA4M) to learn more about what being a part of the PSF Board entails. We also invite you to review our [Annual Impact Report for 2023](https://www.python.org/psf/annual-report/2023/) to learn more about the PSF mission and what we do. Current Board members want to share what being on the Board is like and are making themselves available to answer all your questions about responsibilities, activities, and time commitments via online chat. Please join us on the [PSF Discord](https://discord.gg/4Hm36PPgpG) for the [Board Election Office Hours](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/05/blog-post.html) (June 11th, 4-5 PM UTC and June 18th, 12-1 PM UTC) to talk with us about running for the PSF Board.
