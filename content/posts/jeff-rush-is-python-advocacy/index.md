The PSF has signed a contract with Jeff Rush of Tau Productions, Inc to fund [his proposal](http://python.org/psf/grants/advocacy/orig-proposal.pdf) to act as Python Advocacy Coordinator for six months. In this position, Jeff will work full time on developing and implementing an effective advocacy strategy for Python. His tasks will include writing content for the website and printable brochures for conferences, expanding Python's coverage in technical journals, and building a more effective network of advocacy volunteers from the community. Jeff is known for his work on PyCon 2006, and will be reporting to a group of several PSF directors and officers (initially Stephan Deibel, Chairman of the Board, and Neal Norwitz, Assistant Treasurer).
