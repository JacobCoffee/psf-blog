2018 is drawing to a close and we are excited to start the official **Python Developers Survey for 2018**! In 2017, Python Software Foundation together with JetBrains conducted an official Python Developers Survey for the first time. Over 9,500 developers from almost 150 different countries participated to help us map out an accurate landscape of the Python community. With this second iteration of the official Python Developers Survey, we aim to identify how the Python development world looks today and how it compares to last year. The results of the survey will serve as a major source of knowledge about the current state of the Python community, so we encourage you to participate and make an invaluable contribution to this community resource. The survey takes approximately 10 minutes to complete.  
[Please take a few minutes to complete the Python Developers Survey 2018!](https://surveys.jetbrains.com/s3/c11-python-developers-survey-2018) Your valuable opinion and feedback will help us better understand how different Python developers use Python, related frameworks, tools, and technologies. We also hope you'll have fun going through the questions. The survey is organized in partnership between the Python Software Foundation and JetBrains. After the survey is over, we will publish the aggregated results and randomly choose 100 winners (those who complete the survey in its entirety), who will each receive an amazing **Python Surprise Gift Pack**.
