This year we are conducting the fourth iteration of the official Python Developers Survey. The goal is to capture the current state of the language and the ecosystem around it. By comparing the results with last year’s, we can identify and share with everyone the hottest trends in the Python community and the key insights into it.

In 2019, more than 24,000 Python users from 150 countries participated and shared with us how they use the language.

We encourage you to contribute to our community’s knowledge. The survey should only take you about 10 minutes to complete.

Contribute to the [Python Developers Survey 2020]( https://surveys.jetbrains.com/s3/c12-python-developers-survey-2020)!

The survey is organized in partnership between the Python Software Foundation and JetBrains. After the survey is over, we will publish the aggregated results and randomly choose 100 winners (among those who complete the survey in its entirety), who will each receive an amazing Python Surprise Gift Pack.
