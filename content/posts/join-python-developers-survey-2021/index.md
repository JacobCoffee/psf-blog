This year we are conducting the fifth iteration of the official **Python Developers Survey**. The goal is to capture the current state of the language and the ecosystem around it. By comparing the results with last year's, we can identify and share with everyone the hottest trends in the Python community and the key insights into them.

In 2020, more than 28,000 Python users from 150 countries participated and shared with us how they use the language.

We encourage you to contribute to our community's knowledge. The survey should only take you about **10-15 minutes** to complete.

Contribute to the [Python Developers Survey 2021](https://surveys.jetbrains.com/s3/c1-python-developers-survey-2021).

This year we have added questions that will help the CPython Developer-in-Residence and the Python Packaging Project Manager prioritize their work based on community feedback.

The survey is organized in partnership between the Python Software Foundation and JetBrains. After the survey is over, we will publish the aggregated results and randomly choose 20 winners (among those who complete the survey in its entirety), who will each receive a **$100 Amazon Gift Card** or a local equivalent.
