On Friday October 30th at 11:15 AM EDT the Python Software Foundation will be live streaming a remote key generation and signing ceremony to bootstrap [The Update Framework](https://theupdateframework.io/) for [The Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/). You can click [here](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=PSF+TUF+key+generation+and+signing+ceremony&iso=20201030T1115&p1=179) to see what time this is in your local timezone.

This ceremony is one of the first practical steps in deploying [The Update Framework](https://theupdateframework.io/) to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) per [PEP 458](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0458/).

The Python Software Foundation Director of Infrastructure, Ernest W. Durbin III, and Trail of Bits Senior Security Engineer, William Woodruff, will be executing the runbook developed at https://github.com/psf/psf-tuf-runbook.

For transparency purposes a live stream will be hosted from the [Python Software Foundation's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUAVDPguRzqHySnZw64CcOg). Please subscribe to the channel to be notified when the stream is live if you'd like to follow along.

Additionally the recording will be archived on the [Python Software Foundation's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUAVDPguRzqHySnZw64CcOg).

This work is being funded by [Facebook Research](https://research.fb.com/) and was originally announced in [late 2018](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2018/12/upcoming-pypi-improvements-for-2019.html) and a portion of it commenced in 2019 while awaiting PEP 458's acceptance. With PEP 458 in place [we announced that work would commence in March](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/03/an-update-pypi-funded-work.html).

We appreciate the patience and contributions of the community, [Facebook Research](https://research.fb.com/), and [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/) in seeing through the implementation of PEP 458.

Additionally volunteers from [The Secure Systems Lab at NYU](https://ssl.engineering.nyu.edu/), [Datadog](https://datadoghq.com/), and [VMWare](https://www.vmware.com/) have helped to develop the implementation for PyPI but have begun work on client implementations to verify the results in [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).
