The 2011 Kiwi Python Conference was awarded a US$2,000 grant from the Python Software Foundation during the latter's March board meeting. Kiwi PyCon is the premier Python Conference of New Zealand and will by held in Wellington from August 27th through the 28th. It is organized by the New Zealand Python Users Group (NZPUG). You can [register](http://nz.pycon.org/) now to make sure your spot is reserved. The organizers are currently looking for proposals for talks on all aspects of Python, so you have an opportunity to get involved and submit a talk. Now is a good time for you to take that trip to New Zealand that you have always wanted!
