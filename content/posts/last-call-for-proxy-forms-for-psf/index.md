[PyCon](http://us.pycon.org) begins next week. On the evening of Friday February 23rd is the PSF's annual members' meeting. Many PSF members will be in attendance, but for those who won't: **please send in your proxy forms or absentee ballots NOW**! See [the meeting agenda](http://www.python.org/psf/records/members/2007-02-23/) for links. Forms have to be faxed or emailed to the PSF Secretary by Monday February 19; full details are on the forms.

PSF members represent the Python community. The minimum commitment of each PSF member is to vote in person or by proxy at annual Python Software Foundation meetings and to keep the PSF updated with address changes. [See the PSF Membership FAQ.](http://www.python.org/psf/membership/)
