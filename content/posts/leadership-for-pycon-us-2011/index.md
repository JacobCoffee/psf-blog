The PyCon organizing committee has started making plans for PyCon US 2011, to be held in Atlanta, GA on March 9-17 of next year. One of the first steps is ensuring that the conference committee leadership is in place.

Van Lindberg returns as Conference Chair this year. Van manages all of the activities related to running [PyCon US](http://us.pycon.org/), including organizing the volunteer and paid efforts.

This year Jesse Noller will be assisting Van as Vice Chair. Jesse's primary responsibility is serving as the Program Committee Chair, but he will work with Van in other areas as well.

Doug Napoleone will be the Technical Chair. He is overseeing the redevelopment of the PyCon web site, including the talk selection and schedule management software. Doug will also be responsible for coordinating the technical vendors for the conference, including A/V, networking, and recording.

Greg Lindstrom is returning as Tutorials Coordinator. Greg has been organizing tutorials for a number of years, and his patience and skill have been a big factor in the successful tutorial program that has grown from eight tutorials several years ago to the [32 sessions we regularly have now](http://us.pycon.org/2010/tutorials/).

Vern Ceder is returning for a second year as Poster Sessions Coordinator. The poster sessions were [one of the big hits at PyCon 2010](http://us.pycon.org/2010/conference/posters/), and we expect that they will be much bigger for 2011.

#### Volunteering

Although having good leadership is important, five people cannot organize a conference as big as PyCon. The organizing committee depends on the participation of *dozens* of volunteers from the community to do most of the work. If you would like to help, join the [PyCon organizers mailing list](http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pycon-organizers) and follow [the blog](http://pycon.blogspot.com/) to keep up with other announcements.
