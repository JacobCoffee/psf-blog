We're thrilled to announce that we will be matching donations made to the [PyPy](http://pypy.org/) project for the month of September. For every dollar donated this month, the PSF will also give a dollar, up to a $10,000 total contribution. Head to [**http://pypy.org/**](http://pypy.org/) and view the donation options on the right side of the page, including general funding or a donation targeted to their STM, Py3k, or NumPy efforts. We've previously given a $10,000 donation to PyPy, and more recently seeded the STM efforts with $5,000. The PyPy project works with the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/) to manage fund raising efforts and the usage of the funds, and they'll be the ones notifying us of how you all made your donations. At the end of the month, we'll do our part and chip in to making PyPy even better. The matching period runs today through the end of September.
