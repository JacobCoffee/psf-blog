The PSF is organizing a second members' meeting this year, and the first ever held outside of the United States.

In the past, official meetings of the members of the Foundation have been held at [PyCon US](http://us.pycon.org/). This summer, a meeting is being organized for 19:00 GMT+1/BST Monday, July 19 to be held in conjunction with [EuroPython](http://www.europython.eu/) in Birmingham, UK.

An [agenda for the meeting](http://wiki.python.org/psf/MembersAgenda) is being prepared online. It currently includes proposals for increasing the presence of the Python Software Foundation in Europe through a partner network and/or branch of the Foundation. As with the meeting in February, official voting on resolutions put forward will take place online a short time after the in-person event.

The meeting is open to all PSF members, not just those from Europe. If you plan to attend, please contact Marc-André Lemburg so he can make sure a large enough room is reserved.
