The Python Software Foundation has presented a [Community Service Award](http://www.python.org/community/awards/psf-awards/) for the fourth quarter of 2011 to [Mike Müller](http://www.mindhog.net/~mmuller/) for his outstanding work in bringing Python forward in the science world, through the organization of the first two [EuroSciPy](http://www.euroscipy.org/) conferences and for heading the new yearly [PyCon DE](http://de.pycon.org/) conference, which gives the large number of German speaking Python users a platform for interchange and discussion.

The Python Software Foundation is pleased to recognize Mike's contributions to the community.
