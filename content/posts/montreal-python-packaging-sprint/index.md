The [Montréal-Python](http://montrealpython.org/) user group is holding a sprint to work on the Python packaging system Monday July 5, 2010.

Montréal-Python has been sprinting together since November 2009, and this will be the fifth in a series of sprints on packaging the group has held since March 2010. The goals for this week are being coordinated with Tarek Ziadé and the other developers from the team working on [Distribute](http://packages.python.org/distribute/) and [distutils2](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Distutils2), the new packaging libraries for Python. Returning participants will resume work that was begun at the previous meetings, and new sprinters will be given assistance learning their way around the code and configuring a development environment.

#### Details for Participants

The sprint will be held at [Brasseurs Numériques](http://ajah.ca/blog/), 1124 Marie-Anne, Suite 11, starting at 6:30 PM EDT (UTC -4). The facility is limited to 12 persons so if you plan to attend in person please [RSVP on the wiki](http://wiki.montrealpython.org/index.php/Packaging_no.5). You can also participate online by joining #montreal-python on irc.freenode.net
