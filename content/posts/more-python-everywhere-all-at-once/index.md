The PSF works hard throughout the year to put on [PyCon US](https://us.pycon.org/2023/), support smaller Python events around the world through our [Grants program](https://www.python.org/psf/grants/) and of course to provide the critical infrastructure and expertise that keep CPython and PyPI running smoothly for the 8 million (and growing!) worldwide base of Python users. We want to invest more deeply in education and outreach in 2023, and donations from individuals (like you) can make sure we have the resources to start new projects and sustain them alongside our critical community functions. [Supporting Membership](https://www.python.org/psf/donations/2022-q4-drive/) is a particularly great way to contribute to the PSF. By becoming a Supporting Member, you join a core group of PSF stakeholders, and since Supporting Members are eligible to vote in our Board and bylaws elections, you gain a voice in the future of the PSF. And we have just introduced [a new sliding scale rate for Supporting Members](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/12/introducing-new-sliding-scale-membership.html), so you can join at the standard rate of an annual $99 contribution, or for as little as $25 annually if that works better for you. We are about three quarters of the way to our goal of 100 new supporting members by the end of 2022 – Can you [sign up today](https://psfmember.org/civicrm/contribute/transact/?reset=1&id=1) and help push us over the edge? Thank you for reading and for being a part of the one-of-a-kind community that makes Python and the PSF so special. With warmest wishes to you and yours for a happy and healthy new year,  
Deb
