He also organizes meetings of the Brisbane Python User Group, [BrisPy](https://sites.google.com/site/brisbanepy/), held at the NetboxBlue for the locals that want to attend. Get a glimpse into Stephen's activities via [his blog](http://shiny.thorne.id.au/).

#### New Sponsor Member

In addition to the nominated members, a new sponsor member, [Exoweb](http://www.exoweb.net/en/), was approved. Sponsor members are also nominated and voted by the PSF's current members, but they have to pay a yearly fee to the Foundation.

Exoweb has been pro-active in helping the PSF to ensure the [python.cn](http://python.cn/) domain and [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/#!/pythonlang) are properly managed. Also, the company hosts the Chinese Python bulletin-board and is well known among the Asia-Pacific Python community. Internally, Exoweb takes advantage of Python capabilities on various systems for sys-admin scripting and uses Django and Twisted in their product pipeline. The main reasons they adopted Python are the ease of use, excellent performance, and development optimizations.
