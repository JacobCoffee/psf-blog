The Python Software Foundation is pleased to announce our participation in co-starting a new [Open Initiative for Cybersecurity Standards](https://outreach.eclipse.foundation/open-source-cybersecurity-specifications) collaboration with the Apache Software Foundation, the Eclipse Foundation, other code-hosting open source foundations, SMEs, industry players, and researchers. This collaboration is focused on meeting the real challenges of cybersecurity in the open source ecosystem, and demonstrating full cooperation with and supporting the implementation of the European Union’s Cyber Resilience Act (CRA). With our combined efforts, we are optimistic that we will reach our goal of establishing common specifications for secure open source development based on existing open source best practices.

New regulations, such as those in the CRA, highlight the need for secure by design and strong supply chain security standards. The CRA will lead to standard requests from the Commission to the European Standards Organisations and we foresee requirements from the United States and other regions in the future. As open source foundations, we want to respond to these requests proactively by establishing common specifications for secure software development and meet the expectations of the newly defined term Open Source Steward.

Open source communities and foundations, including the Python community, have long been practicing and documenting secure software development processes. The starting points for creating common specifications around security are already there, thanks to millions of contributions to hundreds of open source projects. In the true spirit of open source, we plan to learn from, adapt, and build upon what already exists for the collective betterment of our greater software ecosystem.

The PSF’s Executive Director Deb Nicholson will attend and participate in the initial Open Initiative for Cybersecurity Standards meetings. Later on, various PSF staff members will join in relevant parts of the conversation to help guide the initiative alongside their peers. The PSF looks forward to more investment in cybersecurity best practices by Python and the industry overall.

This community-driven initiative will have a lasting impact on the future of cybersecurity and our shared open source communities. We welcome you to join this collaborative effort to develop secure open source development specifications. Participate by sharing your knowledge, input, and raising up existing community contributions. Sign up for the [Open Initiative for Process Specifications mailing list](https://outreach.eclipse.foundation/open-source-cybersecurity-specifications) to get involved and stay updated on this initiative. Check out the press release's from the [Eclipse Foundation’s](https://eclipse-foundation.blog/2024/04/02/open-source-community-cra-compliance/) and the [Apache Software Foundation](https://news.apache.org/?p=5859) for more information.
