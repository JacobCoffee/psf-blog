The next official meeting for members of the Python Software Foundation will be held Tuesday, 21 June 2011 [19:30 CEST (local time)](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20110621T1930&p1=215) at [EuroPython](http://ep2011.europython.eu/) in Florence, Italy. The meeting will take place at the EuroPython conference venue, the [Grand Hotel Mediterraneo](http://www.fhhotelgroup.it/eng/grand_hotel_mediterraneo/grand_hotel_mediterraneo.htm). Attendance is expected to be similar to the event as last year in Birmingham, when 30 PSF members and 8 invited non-members participated.

If you plan to attend, please contact meeting chair Marc-André Lemburg so we can estimate the size of the room we will need.

For more details, see the [Members Meeting Agenda](http://wiki.python.org/psf/MembersAgenda) in the PSF wiki.
