[No Starch Press](https://nostarch.com/), an indie tech-book publisher and Community sponsor of the PSF, just announced a partnership with Humble Bundle that lets you pay what you want for all-Python DRM-free ebook titles for Python beginners to pros. And a share of the proceeds from the bundle goes to the PSF!

The “[Python, by No Starch Press](https://www.humblebundle.com/books/python-no-starch-press-books)” bundle runs now through May 23rd and benefits the PSF as well as Hacker Initiative, a public 501(c)(3) organization for hackers, created by NSP founder Bill Pollock.  

The bundle includes picks for all levels like *Python Crash Course* (Eric Matthes), *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python* (Al Sweigart), and *Doing Math with Python* (Amit Saha). The promotion has a pay-what-you-want model, so you can choose a pricing tier for up to 18 ebooks, then decide how much of your purchase goes to the featured causes.

Pricing starts at $1 for *Python Playground* (Mahesh Venkitachalam) + *Doing Math with Python*, or starting at $30 you can get all 18 Python ebooks!
