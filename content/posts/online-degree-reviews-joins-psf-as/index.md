The Python Software Foundation is happy to welcome [Online Degree Reviews](http://www.onlinedegreereviews.org/) as a sponsor member. The Online Degree Reviews website allows students to review and discuss experiences about online college degrees. The site is written in Python using the Django web framework.

Steve Rawlinson gave their reasons for signing up to sponsor the Foundation:

> We'd like to give back to the Python community that made Online Degree Reviews possible by using some of the advertising revenues the site generates. We hope that our sponsorship of the Python Software Foundation will allow developers to focus on what they do best, including continued improvements to the language, and support the Python language eco-system.

#### Becoming a Sponsor

Sponsor members pay annual dues to support the Foundation's activities. Prospective sponsor members apply for membership to the PSF board. The board verifies that they meet the criteria set out for sponsor members and then votes on whether to recommend them for sponsor membership in the next election. For more information about membership in the Python Software Foundation, refer to the [Membership FAQ](http://python.org/psf/membership/).
