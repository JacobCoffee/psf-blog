Further to our recent cogitations on better meeting the PSF's goals the Board has taken a number of decisions which I'd like to let you know about.

-   I am in the process of appointing a part-time administrator to help us with the more mundane tasks. I anticipate this will initially require between 10 and 20 hours per week, and be performed on a contract basis.
-   Kurt Kaiser, our Treasurer, will commit to spending a quarter of his time on PSF-related duties. His remuneration will increase to give him a reasonable hourly rate for the job.
-   David Goodger has accepted a six-month contract as paid chairman of PyCon. Besides organizing next year's conference he will focus on ensuring that the chairman's role is properly documented, allowing us to respond appropriately to the development needs of the conference.

We are currently in a transitional phase: Kurt has assumed his enlarged role with immediate effect; I anticipate that David and the new administrator will take up their posts early in December. Hopefully this will mean we are able to more adequately take care of business.

The Board will be assessing the impact of these changes over time, and review the overall position after PyCon. In the meantime we will welcome any observations from you about how the changes affect the way the Foundation serves you.

Follow-up: The administrator position is now filled
