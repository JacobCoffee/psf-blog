Last year the Python Software Foundation was [announced as a CVE Numbering Authority](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2023/08/psf-authorized-as-cna.html) (CNA) to manage and assign CVE IDs for CPython and pip. Becoming a CVE Numbering Authority allows the PSF to provide expertise about Python in the CVE ecosystem, ensuring that users have accurate and up-to-date information about vulnerabilities affecting key projects. Today, the PSF is [expanding our CNA scope](https://www.python.org/cve-numbering-authority/) to also include Pallets projects, such as [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask), [Jinja](https://github.com/pallets/jinja), [Click](https://github.com/pallets/click), and [Quart](https://github.com/pallets/quart). For a complete list, see [the Pallets organization on GitHub](https://github.com/pallets). Please report any security vulnerabilities for these projects following [the Pallets security policy](https://palletsprojects.com/security).  
This work is being done to learn how the PSF can better serve Python's large ecosystem of projects in the context of the CVE ecosystem. The PSF previously [published a guide](https://openssf.org/blog/2023/11/27/openssf-introduces-guide-to-becoming-a-cve-numbering-authority-as-an-open-source-project/) on how open source projects can become their own CVE Numbering Authorities. You can learn more about the [CVE CNA program](https://www.cve.org/PartnerInformation/Partner#CNA) on the CVE website.  

Pallets is a fiscal sponsoree of the Python Software Foundation. Fiscal sponsorship is a key plank of the PSF’s mission in supporting the Python community. The PSF supports [20 fiscal sponsorees](https://www.python.org/psf/fiscal-sponsorees/) including regional PyCons, Python Meetup and User Groups, and Python projects. Learn more about our Fiscal Sponsorees on [our website](https://www.python.org/psf/fiscal-sponsorees/) and consider [supporting the groups with a US-tax deductible donation](https://linktr.ee/thepsf).
