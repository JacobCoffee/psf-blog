We are so very grateful for each of you who donated or became new members during our end-of-year fundraiser and membership drive. We raised $30,000 through the [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) promotion offered by [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/)– WOW! Including individual donations, Supporting Memberships, donations to our Fiscal Sponsorees, and JetBrains’ generous partnership we raised around $99,000 for the PSF’s mission supporting Python and its community. Your generous support means we can dive into 2025 ready to invest in our key goals for the year. Some of our goals include:  

-   Embrace the opportunities and tackle the challenges that come with scale
-   Foster long term sustainable growth- for Python, the PSF, and the community
-   Improve workflows through iterative improvement in collaboration with the community

Each bit of investment from the Python community—money, time, energy, ideas, and enthusiasm—helps us to reach these goals! We want to specifically call out to our new members: welcome aboard, thank you for joining us, and we are so appreciative of you! We’re looking forward to having your voice take part in the PSF’s future. If you aren’t a member of the PSF yet, check out our [Membership page](https://www.python.org/psf/membership/supporting/), which includes details about our sliding scale memberships. We are happy to welcome new members any time of year! As always, we want to thank those in the community who took the time to share our posts on social media and their local or project based networks. We’re excited about what 2025 has in store for Python and the PSF, and as always, we’d love to hear your ideas and feedback. Looking for how to keep in touch with us? You can find all the ways in our "[Where to find the PSF?](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/11/where-is-psf.html)" blog post. We wish you a perfectly Pythonic year ahead!
