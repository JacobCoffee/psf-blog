The PSF holds a registered trademark on the word "Python". Every few weeks someone writes to the board and asks permission to distribute a program with the word "Python" in its name or to do something with the Python logo. The PSF's board wanted to have a document explaining the PSF's goals for the trademark and discussing common use cases.

During Monday's board meeting, we voted to adopt the policy available at [www.python.org/psf/trademarks](http://www.python.org/psf/trademarks/). This document is version 1.2.2 because it went through a few rounds of rewriting on the board and PSF-members mailing lists, as well as some checking by the PSF's counsel.

We hope the policy is reasonably clear and understandable. If in doubt about any usage of the trademark, please write the PSF at (psf at python dot org).
