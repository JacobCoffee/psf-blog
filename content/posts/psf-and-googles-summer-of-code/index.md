The Python Software Foundation is again participating in Google's Summer of Code; students can apply for funding to work on projects over the summer, and be paired with an experienced mentor who will provide advice and guidance. [James Tauber](http://www.jtauber.com) is the PSF's coordinator for the Summer of Code.

This year, the PSF is reserving a certain number of slots for projects related to CPython or Jython.

If you'd like to apply as a student participant, please see the wiki page [wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode](http://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode) for more information, including project ideas, the list of mentors, and instructions and tips on how to apply.
