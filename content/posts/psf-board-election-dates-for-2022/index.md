Nominations should be made through [this form](https://www.python.org/nominations/2022-python-software-foundation-board/create/) (Note: you will need to sign into or create your python.org user account first). You can nominate yourself or someone else, but no one will be forced to run, so you may want to consider reaching out to someone before nominating them.
