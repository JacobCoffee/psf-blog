Board elections are a chance for the community to choose representatives to help the PSF create a vision for and build the future of the Python community. This year there are 4 seats open on the PSF board. You can see who is on the board currently [here](https://www.python.org/psf/records/board/history/). (Dustin Ingram, Jeff Triplett, Nina Zakharenko and Thomas Wouters are at the end of their current terms.)

You will need to be a contributing, managing, supporting, or fellow member by June 15th to vote in this election. Learn more about membership [here](https://www.python.org/psf/membership/) or if you have questions about membership or nominations please email [psf-elections@python.org](mailto:psf-elections@python.org) Who runs for the board? People that care about the Python community, who want to see it flourish and grow and also have a few hours a month to attend regular meetings, serve on committees, participate in conversations and promote the Python community. You can learn more about what the PSF board does [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLKj6FaQA4M). You can nominate yourself or someone else, but no one will be forced to run, so you may want to consider reaching out to someone before nominating them. Nominations open on June 1st, so you have a few weeks to research the role and craft a nomination statement. You are welcome to join the discussion about the PSF Board election on [our forum](https://discuss.python.org/c/python-software-foundation/9) or come find us [in Slack](https://psf-board.slack.com/). This year we’ll also be running office hours in Telegraph to answer questions about running for the board and serving on the board. Those will be announced soon!
