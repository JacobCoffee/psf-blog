### Run for the Board

Who runs for the board? People who care about the Python community, who want to see it flourish and grow, and also have a few hours a month to attend regular meetings, serve on committees, participate in conversations, and promote the Python community. Check out our [Life as Python Software Foundation Director video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLKj6FaQA4M) to learn more about what being a part of the PSF Board entails. We also invite you to review our [Annual Impact Report for 2023](https://www.python.org/psf/annual-report/2023/) to learn more about the PSF mission and what we do. You can nominate yourself or someone else. We would encourage you to reach out to folks before you nominate them to make sure they are enthusiastic about the potential of joining the Board. Nominations open on Tuesday, June 11th, 2:00 pm UTC, so you have a few weeks to research the role and craft a nomination statement.
