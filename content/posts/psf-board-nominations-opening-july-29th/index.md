This year’s PSF Board Election nomination period opens next week on Tuesday, July 29th, 2:00 pm UTC and closes on Tuesday, August 12th, 2:00 pm UTC. Who runs for the board? People who care about the Python community, who want to see it flourish and grow, and also have a few hours a month to attend regular meetings, serve on committees, participate in conversations, and promote the Python community.

This year, there are 4 seats open on the PSF Board. Check out who is currently on the PSF Board on [our website](https://www.python.org/psf/board/). (Dawn Wages, Jannis Leidel, Kushal Das, and Simon Willison are at the end of their current terms.)

#### Nomination details

You can nominate yourself or someone else. We encourage you to reach out to people before you nominate them to ensure they are enthusiastic about the potential of joining the Board.

**To submit a nomination for yourself or someone else, use the [2025 PSF Board Election Nomination Form](https://www.python.org/nominations/2025-python-software-foundation-board/create/) on our website. The nomination form opens on Tuesday, July 29th, 2:00 pm UTC and closes on Tuesday, August 12th, 2:00 pm UTC.** To support potential candidates and nominators, the 2025 PSF Board Election team has created a [nomination resource](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tjtfJlKGeJ3o6eeDBj5--1NZZL2v51fb/view?usp=sharing) (embedded below). It includes tips, formatting instructions, and guidance on what to include in a nomination. The goal is to help nominees understand what to expect and ensure that all candidates are provided the same clear and consistent standards.
