#### The 2010 Board of Directors

**Raymond Hettinger** has been a contributor to the Python core for 10 years, and has worked on many of the standard library modules, including itertools, sets, and collections. He regularly speaks at Python and Open Source conferences around the world. He is currently working on an update to the *Python Cookbook*, as well as the *Python Swallowed Whole* book project. In 2009, he lead an ongoing effort to ensure that we have signed [contributor agreements](http://www.python.org/psf/contrib/contrib-form/) from all contributors to Python core or the standard library. Raymond is Director of Technology at SauceLabs and is a Certified Public Accountant.

**Steve Holden** joined the PSF in 2003, its Board of Directors in 2004, and became Chairman in 2008. He founded and chaired the first Python community conference, establishing PyCon as the premier event for Pythonistas in North America. He again chaired PyCon in 2004 and 2005. He received the [Frank Willison Memorial Award](http://www.python.org/community/awards/frank-willison/) in 2007 for his services to the Python community. He is the author of *Python Web Programming* and for two years wrote the monthly "Random Hits" column in [Python Magazine](http://www.pythonmagazine.com/). Steve runs Holden Web LLC, a consulting and training company with a strong Python focus.

**Marc-André Lemburg** been working with Python since 1993 and on Python since 1997 as core developer. His major contributions include the design for Unicode integration, the codecs subsystem, pybench, and the platform module. From 2002-2004 Marc-André served on the PSF board and was PSF vice president in 2003-2004. He started the Public Support Committee (PSC) as a way of looking for income sources for the PSF. He also initiated the work of having signed Python [contributor agreements](http://www.python.org/psf/contrib/contrib-form/) for all contributors. Marc-André's company eGenix.com provides Python project support and produces several Python extension libraries for working with dates, text processing, and ODBC connectivity.

**David Mertz** is currently Chair of the PSF's Trademarks Committee, and served as Vice Chair last year. He proposed the adoption of a 2009 [diversity statement](http://www.python.org/community/diversity/) by the Board. He is a developer and author, most notably of *Text Processing in Python* and the IBM developerWorks' column *Charming Python*. He is also co-authoring the updated 3rd Edition of *The Python Cookbook*. As CTO and board member of the [Open Voting Consortium](http://www.openvotingconsortium.org/), David advocated for the use of Python to create an Open Source voting platform. For the last couple years, David has been consulting for [D.E.Shaw Research](http://www.deshawresearch.com/), builders of [\*Anton\*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_\(computer\)), the world's fastest supercomputer for doing computational biochemistry.

**Doug Napoleone** has developed with Python for the past 10 years and has been active in the community for 7 years. He is the lead developer of the PyCon-tech project, the application for managing most aspects of the [PyCon US](http://us.pycon.org/) conference. He is also active on several organizing committees for PyCon US. Doug has worked with and helped organize three local Python user groups.

**Jesse Noller** is a prominent Python-dev team member, especially noted for his contributions to the multiprocessing module. He has been working with Python for over five years, on a variety of projects including distributed systems and automation frameworks.

**Tim Peters** has served on the Board since its inception. He corresponded extensively with Guido about Python's design before its first public release in the early 1990s, and contributed to many areas of the language implementation over the years, especially to optimization of time-critical paths. Other contributions include the first POSIX thread implementation, the first Python port to a 64-bit machine, the Emacs Python mode, [The Zen of Python](http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/), [SpamBayes](http://spambayes.sourceforge.net/), [doctest](http://docs.python.org/library/doctest.html), and [Python's sorting algorithms](http://bugs.python.org/file4451/timsort.txt).

**Allison Randal** is architect of the [Parrot VM](http://www.parrot.org/), as well as the lead developer of [Pynie](http://code.google.com/p/pynie/) (an implementation of Python 3 on Parrot).

#### The Python Software Foundation

The [mission of the PSF](http://www.python.org/psf/mission/):

> The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers.

#### About the Board

PSF Directors are elected annually and are responsible for managing the business of the foundation, as outlined in the [bylaws](http://www.python.org/psf/bylaws/). They fulfill two responsibilities:

1.  Completing or overseeing administrative tasks related to the legal standing of the Foundation. These include responding to trademark or licensing queries and monitoring the Foundation's financial health.
2.  Completing "special projects" such as [fund raising](http://www.python.org/psf/donations/), [administering grants](http://www.python.org/psf/grants/), and supporting day-to-day operations of the Python community.

A director's specific duties depend on the office and any sub-committee memberships held. The board meets monthly via IRC. Minutes from the meetings are [available online](http://www.python.org/psf/records/board/minutes/). Most Directors are volunteers, although some Officer positions (Treasurer and Secretary) do receive a nominal salary.
