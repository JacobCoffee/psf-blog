The PSF Board has awarded a grant of USD $840 to the [Read the Docs](http://readthedocs.org) project for twelve months of hosting fees.

#### Read the Docs

Created by [Eric Holscher](http://ericholscher.com/), [Charles Leifer](http://charlesleifer.com/), and [Bobby Grace](http://bobbygrace.info/), readthedocs.org is a documentation hosting site born out of the 2010 Django Dash competition. The site monitors git, Mercurial, and Subversion source repositories and automatically builds a project's documentation using Sphinx. Users can also create documentation directly through the site using a built-in editor.

The [code for Read the Docs](http://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org) is itself open source, and contributions from users and other interested parties are always welcome.

#### More Details

The [original announcement](http://ericholscher.com/blog/2010/aug/16/announcing-read-docs/) of the site describes the background for the project and its motivation.

Eric's [presentation at PDX Python](http://www.slideshare.net/ericholscher/read-the-docs) in February 2011 includes details about the tools used to build the site.

The [Getting Started Guide](http://read-the-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) covers all of the details you need to add the documentation for your project to the site.
