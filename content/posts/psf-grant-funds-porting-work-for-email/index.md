R. David Murray recently completed work funded by the PSF to update Python's email package to work with Python 3.2. The result of the project is a fully functioning version of the standard library package for parsing and constructing email messages.

#### Project History

The version of the [email](http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/email.html) package that was shipped with Python 3.0 and 3.1 had some bugs, not the least of which was the inability to handle binary inputs. The parser was limited to files and messages in ASCII. Due to this, under Python 3 the email module could only create messages and never receive anything. This deficiency broke many applications that depend on email. For example, the [cgi](http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/cgi.html) package uses the email package to process binary uploads.

After discussions held in the [email-sig discussion group](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/email-sig/), a complete rewrite of the API was suggested as the only option and R. David Murray submitted a [proposal](http://www.bitdance.com/projects/email6/psfproposal/) to the PSF to fund the development of Email 6. The proposal was initially accepted, and some seed money (including matching funds) were provided. Since then, additional funding has been provided by [QNX](http://qnx.com/).

At first, David spent some time working on the Policy framework, and with some help from Antoine Pitrou, who fixed some issues in the [nntp](http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/nntplib.html) module, David devised a way to integrated byte handling in the email package without a complete rewrite of the original code by using extensions to the API that allow it to accept and generate bytes. The implementation used the "surrogateescape" mechanism, developed by Martin von Löwis, allowing minimum code modifications.

David also provided some modifications to [smtplib](http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/smtplib.html), enabling it to transmit messages with non-ASCII characters. He also worked with Victor Stinner to give the cgi module the ability to handle binary data. They then took on the task of updating the [mailbox](http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/mailbox.html) module, and using the new features coded initially by David, made mailbox fully functional for Python 3.2.

David mentions that there are still some bugs, specially in the transition to the string/byte separation, but, also according to him, these bugs were greatly reduced in version 3.2.

All this work gave Python 3.2 a fully functional email handling package. The nntplib, smtplib, email, cgi and mailbox modules were also made functional, something that benefits the whole Python community. The grant provided by PSF paved the way to reach full functionality.
