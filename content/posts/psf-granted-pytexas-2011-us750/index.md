The Python Software Foundation gave the recent [PyTexas](http://www.pytexas.org/2011/) conference US$750 in funds.

#### About the Conference

PyTexas 2011 was the fourth annual free Python programming conference in Texas. It took place Saturday, September 10 - Sunday, September 2011 at the Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas. They have a [blog](http://blog.pytexas.org/) that has some photos from the conference on it. All of the talks at PyTexas were recorded and are starting to appear on [NextDayVideo](http://nextdayvideo.pytexas.org/) and [Miro](http://python.mirocommunity.org). If you would like to help plan next year's conference, you can join the PyTexas mailing [list](http://www.pytexas.org/2011/community/).

They estimate about 170 people attended PyTexas 2011, up from 94 at PyTexas 2010, and 22 at PyTexas 2009.
