Building on [Part 1](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/11/psf-grants-program-updates-part1.html) of this PSF Grants Program Update, we are pleased to share updates to the Grants Workgroup (workgroup) Charter. We have outlined all the changes below in a chart, but there are a couple of changes that we’d like to highlight to grant applicants. These updates in particular will change how and when you apply, and hopefully reduce blockers to getting those applications in and ready for review. Because we are just sharing these updates, we are happy to be flexible on these changes but hope to see all applicants adhere to the changes starting around January 2025.

-   **Increase overall process time frame to 8 weeks (formerly 6 weeks).** We want to be realistic about how long the process takes and we know that going over our projection can cause pain for applicants. We hope to turn around applications in 6 weeks in most cases, but planning for the extra two weeks can make a big difference for everyone involved!

-   Our application form requires that you set the event date out to 6 weeks in advance. We will wait to update that to 8 weeks in advance until January 2025.
-   *It’s important to note that this time frame begins **only once all required information has been received**, not exactly from the day the application is submitted. Make sure to check the email you provided on the application to see if the workgroup Chair has any questions regarding your request!*

-   **Add a statement of support for accessibility services.** In line with the PSF’s mission to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse community, we are explicitly stating in the charter that we will consider funding accessibility services. For established events (have 2 or more events in the past with more than 200 participants at the last event), we are open to considering accessibility-related requests such as live captioning, sign language interpretation, or certified child care.

-   To review these types of requests, we will need sufficient documentation such as quotes, certifications, or any other relevant information.

-   **Add guidelines around program/schedule review.** Previously undocumented, we were checking event programs/schedules to ensure a Python focus as well as a diversity of speakers. Because of event organizing time frames, we often received grant requests before the schedule was available. Moving forward we are accepting 1 of 3 options:

1.  The program/schedule for the event
2.  A tentative schedule or list of accepted speakers/sessions for the event
3.  Programs from previous editions of the event if available, a link to the event’s call for proposals, which should state a required Python focus for the event as well as a statement in support of a diverse speaker group, and a description of the efforts that are being made to ensure a diversity of speakers.

### Grants Workgroup Charter Updates

| Update Summary | Former Charter | Projected Benefit | Observations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Establish fast-track grants: Grants that meet pre-approved criteria skip the review period with the workgroup and go straight to a vote | Did not exist previously | Resolutions reach applicants sooner, reduce load on workgroup | Not many events meet the initial criteria we set to qualify for fast-track review, so this is mostly untested |
| Establish workgroup participation criteria: workgroup members must participate in 60% of the votes to remain active | Did not exist previously | Resolutions reach applicants sooner, set out clear guidelines on the meaning of active participation, reduce load on Chair | Reduction of workgroup membership to only active members has resulted in shorter voting periods by removing blockers to meeting quorum |
| Increase $ amount for PSF Board review: Grant requests over 15K are reviewed by PSF Board | Grant requests over 10K were reviewed by PSF Board | Resolutions reach applicants sooner, reduces load on PSF Board to ensure they are focused on high level efforts | Resolutions have reached applicants sooner, some reduction in load for PSF Board as we are still receiving applications over 15K |
| Increase process timeframe: 8 week processing time from when all information has been received | 6 week processing time from when all information has been received | Improves community satisfaction and sets realistic expectations, reduces stress on workgroup & Chair | We are just sharing this update so it has yet to be tested- come to our Grants Office Hour session to discuss it with us! |
| Establish schedule for Grant review process: 10 day review period and 10 day voting period | Did not exist previously | Improve community satisfaction by ensuring requests are moving through the process promptly | This has worked great to keep things moving as the workgroup has a set expectation of how long they have to comment |
| Establish guideline for workgroup process: no discussion after the vote has begun | Did not exist previously | Improve community satisfaction by ensuring requests are moving hrough the process promptly | While untested, this has set an expectation for the workgroup to comment during the review period |
| Update voting mechanics: Votes will last for 10 days, a majority is reached, or when all voting members have voted, whichever comes first. For a proposal to be successful, it must have ayes in the majority totalling 30% of the WG | Decisions were made by a majority rule (50%+1), with no time limit | Improve community satisfaction by ensuring votes take place promptly, reduce stress on the workgroup and Chair if members are absent or unable to participate | This has worked wonderfully! The Chair no longer has to track down votes. Paired with the participation guideline, voting periods no longer present a bottleneck |
| Removed stated set budget: The annual budget is set by the PSF Board and is subject to change | The previously documented budget was $120,000 (regularly exceeded) | Removes an inaccurate description of the Grants Program budget and the need to update this line yearly | A practical update, no observations to note |
| Update workgroup officer roles: one Chair, one Vice Chair, one Appointed Board Director | One Chair and two Vice Chairs | Correct an unusual and discouraged practice of having two vice chairs and ensures PSF Board participation | A practical update, no observations to note |
| Add a statement of support for accessibility services: for mature events, consideration of granting funds for accessibility services | Did not exist previously | Establishes criteria for the workgroup and Board to consider accessibility-related requests | We are just sharing this update so it has yet to be tested- come to our Grants Office Hour session to discuss it with us! |
| Additional guidelines around grant reviews: tentative schedules OR previous schedules, CfP that shows a Python focus, as well as a description of the efforts being made to ensure a diversity of speakers | Did not exist previously in documented form, though we checked for a program | Improve community satisfaction with the process, remove delays in the grant review process | This has been a great addition, and blockers for many applications have been removed! |

### What’s next?

Still on our Grants Program refresh to-do list is:  

-   Mapping Board-mandated priorities for the Grants Program to policy
-   Charter adjustments as needed, based on the priority mapping  
    
-   Main documentation page re-write
-   Budget template update
-   Application form overhaul
-   Transparency report for 2024
-   Exploration and development of other resources that our grant applicants would find useful

Our community is ever-changing and growing, and we plan to be there every step of the way and continue crafting the Grants Program to serve Pythonistas worldwide. If you have questions or comments, we welcome and encourage you to join us at our monthly [Grants Program Office Hour sessions](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/02/introducing-psf-grants-office-hours.html) on the [PSF Discord](https://discord.gg/7rthGF3BBe).
