The PSF is seeking to hire a Director of Resource Development to spearhead fundraising and sponsorship efforts! We are accepting resumes through January 14th, 2021. See the job description section below for more information.

After 5 years, our sponsorship coordinator, Betsy Waliszewski, is beginning her transition towards retirement. Betsy has been an incredible help to the PSF and the Python community. Our goal is for Betsy to work with the new hire for a dedicated time in Q1. Additionally, Betsy will continue helping with administrative tasks in the first half of 2021 in a part-time capacity. We wish Betsy the best as she begins a new chapter beyond the PSF!

Taking into consideration Betsy's retirement and the financial impact of 2020 and 2021, the PSF's need for this role is now greater than ever. We look forward to reading the resumes that come in!
