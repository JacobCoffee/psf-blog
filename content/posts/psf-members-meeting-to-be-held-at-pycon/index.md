The Python Software Foundation will hold a meeting for current and nominated members on March 11, 2011, from 12:30 pm to 1:20 pm local, in Atlanta, Georgia, USA at the Hyatt Regency Atlanta hotel.

#### Agenda

The agenda for the meeting is still being set. It includes time for newly nominated members to introduce themselves, and for members running for the Board of Directors to present their positions. If you have another topic you would like added to the agenda, please contact PSF Secretary Pat Campbell before the meeting.

#### Elections

In the past, participants at the meeting elected the new board, approved new members of the foundation, and conducted other voting in person. However, last year the PSF switched to an online voting system. That system will be used again this year, with the ballots being sent out on Friday, March 25, 2011.

Proposals that need to be voted on by the PSF membership should be submitted in the form of resolutions. Initial discussions on the members mailing list is encouraged to craft the language for the resolution.

The deadline for nomination of new members and proposal of resolutions to be voted on by the membership is Tuesday, March 22.

#### Call for Nominations of Directors

Please nominate candidates for the PSF Board of Directors by sending email to the PSF Board. Self-nominations are welcome. Current directors should also indicate whether they will stand for election again. Candidates should [post brief bios and position statements in the PSF wiki](http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSoftwareFoundation/BoardCandidates2011).

#### Call for New Member Nominations

New members are nominated to the PSF by current members. To nominate a regular member, first confirm that they are interested in taking on the responsibility, and then post your nomination to the members mailing list.

The prospective member must also complete and submit a [membership application form](http://www.python.org/psf/forms/application/). See the [PSF Membership FAQ](http://www.python.org/psf/membership/) for details
