**On Wednesday, November 21, the Python Software Foundation’s board of directors voted on two [resolutions](http://python.org/psf/records/board/resolutions/) on the topic of Codes of Conduct at Python conferences. As the Python conference landscape grows to include more events and attract more attendees, the Foundation looks to ensure that conferences, new and old, are being run in a way that is enjoyable for all. The first resolution passed by the board serves as the Foundation’s recommendation that all Python conferences and related events create and apply a Code of Conduct. The board unanimously agreed on this point, suggesting that publicly documented expectations and plans of action are necessary when planning and running an event in our community. The second resolution passed by the board serves as the Foundation’s requirement that all Python conferences and related events create and apply a Code of Conduct. Without a code in place, the Foundation will not fund the event. [PyCon US](https://us.pycon.org/2013/), the largest of the Python conferences, first implemented a [Code of Conduct](https://us.pycon.org/2012/codeofconduct/) for the March 2012 conference. For PyCon 2013, [the code](https://us.pycon.org/2013/about/code-of-conduct/) was left the same, but comes with the addition of documented [incident handling guidelines](https://us.pycon.org/2013/about/code-of-conduct/harassment-incidents/). Many conferences followed suit to add a code, such as [PyOhio](http://pyohio.org/blog/2012/07/02/pycon-code-conduct-adopted-pyohio/), [pyArkansas](http://www.pyarkansas.org/about/conduct/), [PyTexas](http://www.pytexas.org/2012/about/conduct/), [PyCon Canada](http://2012.pycon.ca/conduct), and others. PyCon’s Code of Conduct is structured after one created by [The Ada Initiative](http://adainitiative.org/) and others, available under the [Creative Commons Zero](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) license at [http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference\_anti-harassment/Policy](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy).**
