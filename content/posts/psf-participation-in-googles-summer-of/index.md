The PSF is planning to participate in Google's Summer of Code again, and is calling for help from the community. Here's how you can help:

-   Suggest project ideas by recording them on [the SummerOfCode wiki page](http://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode).
-   Volunteer to mentor a student. Send an e-mail to Neal Norwitz (nnorwitz at gmail dot com) to volunteer.

You can discuss any SoC topic on [soc2006@python.org](mailto:soc2006@python.org)
