[![PSF Python Brochure Vol. 1](./image-1.png)](http://brochure.getpython.info/)

**[PSF Python Brochure PDF (low resolution version)](http://brochure.getpython.info/media/releases/psf-python-brochure-vol.-i-final-download.pdf)**  
We are happy to announce that **we have successfully distributed the first 5,000 copies** of the [PSF Python Brochure](http://brochure.getpython.info/) to Python conferences and user groups around the world. Even without doing any major announcement of the possibility to order the brochure for conferences and user groups, we easily received enough requests to have the first print run completely distributed in just a few months. Brochures were sent to [PyCon US 2014](https://us.pycon.org/2014/) in Montreal, [EuroPython 2014](https://ep2014.europython.eu/), PyCons and open source conferences in India, UK, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, France, Belgium and to many professional users around the world.

### Promoting Python to new audiences

  
The feedback we received was positive all around. Conference attendees were really happy to be able to easily show and prove how Python changes the world, to make the point that **learning and using Python is a good investment**. The brochure helps them in promoting Python in their local and professional communities, especially to the many **non-technical people** we cannot easily reach with our [python.org web site](https://www.python.org/). We would like to thank all our sponsors and contributors for their hard work to achieve this impressing result.

### Please help us kick start the second print run !

  
In order to continue with the distribution of the remaining 5,000 copies of the Vol. 1 edition, we are now **looking for two additional half page ad sponsors** to help finance the print run and distribution costs. We have reserved the notes area on the inner back cover page of the brochure for these extra ads. If you would like to **show your support for Python** and its community and **reach out to thousands of people interested in Python**, now is the time to [sign up as ad sponsor](https://encrypted.evenios.com/en/mediadata)!

### Pre-order the PSF Python Brochure  

  
We provide two options for pre-ordering the brochure from the second print run which will be available early in April 2015:  

1.  free [**Community Orders**](https://encrypted.evenios.com/en/mediadata) for conference and user groups
2.  paid [**Company Orders**](https://encrypted.evenios.com/en/mediadata) for companies and organizations

The costs for the community orders are sponsored through sponsor ads, the [PSF](https://www.python.org/psf/) and the company orders.

### More information

  
More information on the brochure, the [idea and people behind it](http://brochure.getpython.info/learn-more), media data and ordering links are available on our project page:
