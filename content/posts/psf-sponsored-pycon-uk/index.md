The PSF was one of the sponsors of [PyCon UK](http://www.pyconuk.org/), which took place September 8th and 9th in Birmingham. $2,500 were donated. About 190 attended the conference. The next PyCon UK will be held the 12th to 14th September 2008 also in Birmingham.

The PSF was also a Gold Sponsor for [PyCon Italia](http://www.pycon.it/), which took place June 9th and 10th in Firenze. 1,500 Euros were donated. Our three free passes were donated to students and others that needed the financial assistance. About 200 attendees were at the conference. The 2008 conference has not yet been scheduled.
