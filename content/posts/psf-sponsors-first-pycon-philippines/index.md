The Python Software Foundation donated USD $600 to the first Python Conference in the [Philippines](http://ph.pycon.org/). The conference will be held in Manila from June 30th to July 1st, 2012. The organizers behind this conference are the Philippines Python User Group (PHPUG), [pyDanny](http://pydanny.com/announcing-pycon-philippines.html), Audrey Roy and various other members of the Python community. You can meet and greet them in a very nice tropical clime. Who wouldn't want to study Python on a beautiful island? They're still accepting registrations, so act fast!
