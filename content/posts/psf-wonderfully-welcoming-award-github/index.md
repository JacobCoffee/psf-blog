\[November 9th, 2023\] - The Python Software Foundation is delighted to announce that we are a recipient of a GitHub Award under the Wonderfully Welcoming category, awarded on November 9th at [GitHub Universe 2023](https://githubuniverse.com/) in San Francisco, CA, USA. This award exemplifies all the Python community strives to be—enthusiastic, dedicated to encouraging use of the language, and committed to building a diverse and friendly community. We are proud of the Python community for embodying our values on GitHub and this award truly belongs to every contributor. We’re incredibly grateful to be in community with you.

> *The GitHub Awards celebrates the outstanding contributions and achievements in the developer community by honoring individuals, projects, and organizations for creating an outsized positive impact on the community. [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf-landing/) ([@psf](https://github.com/psf)) is not just a hub for Python development; it's a community that embraces diversity and inclusion at its core. Through initiatives like PyCon Charlas, PSF breaks language barriers, providing a platform for Spanish-speaking contributors. It also champions gender diversity by backing the pioneering PyLadiesCon. Above all, the PSF is committed to a respectful and safe community experience, fortified by a strong [Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/). It also extends accessibility through captioning and is vigilant about health and safety measures. At PSF, it's not just about code; it's about the people behind it. The Wonderfully Welcoming Award recognizes people or projects that have been the most welcoming and seen an increasing amount of contributors.*

  
The PSF Executive Director, Deb Nicholson, states: *“We believe that empowering new participants is key to the growth and success of the open source movement. We want to thank GitHub for shining a spotlight on the human side of open source community work.”* The Python Software Foundation is a non-profit membership organization devoted to advancing open source technology related to the Python programming language. Our mission is to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers.
