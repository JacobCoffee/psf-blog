The [Python Software Foundation (PSF)](https://www.python.org/psf/) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to the Python community and programming language, as well as running PyCon US. Since [PyCon US 2020 was cancelled](https://pycon.blogspot.com/2020/03/pycon-us-2020-in-pittsburgh.html), the community has asked how the PSF’s finances will be affected. Let us take a look at the projected 2020 financial outcome.

## Bottom Line

As of today, the PSF will use approximately $627,000 from our financial reserve:

|  | Expenses | Revenue |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **PSF** | $1,300,000 | $550,000 | \-$750,000 |
| **PyCon** | $280,000 | $403,000 | $123,000 |
|  |  | **Total** | \-$627,000 |

If you are interested in how we arrived at these estimates, continue reading to learn about our projected expenses and revenue for this year.

## Expenses

### PyCon US 2020

Pittsburgh and its vendors have been incredibly helpful in reducing or eliminating most of the 2020 conference minimums and cancellation fees. We estimate $280,000 in expenses for pre-conference work related to website/logo design and nonrefundable deposits. In addition, we budgeted significant funds to support travel grantees with non-reimbursable costs, as well as executing PyCon 2020 remote content. Once travel grants and instructor fees are complete, we will revise the expense total.

### PSF

Through March 2020, the PSF awarded several [grants\*](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/blogger.g?blogID=8520#grants), expended legal fees to protect PyLadies trademarks in dozens of countries, and employed staff. The PSF is projected to spend $1,300,000 in 2020.

## Revenue

### PyCon US 2020

PyCon US registration and sponsorship revenue is used to produce PyCon, with the largest costs going to food, audio-visual services, and travel grants. Our staff works to create the best and most affordable attendee experience possible with the added benefit that 100% of net proceeds fund the PSF. For 2020, we estimated PyCon’s net income at $720,000. As of today, we are estimating PyCon's net income to be $123,000, thanks to individual donations and sponsorship fees.

### PSF

PSF 2020 sponsorships are estimated at $350,000. COVID-19 is impacting financial markets and job security, so we expect individual donations and memberships to decrease in 2020 by 55% from 2019 to around $200,000.

## How can you help?

The PSF’s financial reserve is crucial, as we experienced during the economic downturn of 2008 and again in 2020. The cash reserve prepares us for economic impacts, events out of our control, and provides a stable environment with health benefits for our employees, even during this difficult time. Here are ways community members can help and get involved:

-   Become a [free or supporting member](https://www.python.org/psf/membership/) of the PSF to get involved in our future
-   Donate some or all of your PyCon registration (***thank you*** to those that already have)
-   [Donate](https://www.python.org/psf/donations/) directly to the PSF
-   Donate some or all of your company's PyCon's sponsorship (***thank you*** to those that already have)
-   Ask your employer to [sponsor the PSF](https://www.python.org/psf/sponsorship/)
-   Ask your employer if they match donations to 501(c)(3) non-profits, and ask for your donations to the PSF to be matched
-   [Sign up for the PSF’s free newsletter](https://www.python.org/psf/newsletter/) to stay up to date

  
We wish our entire community good health. [\*](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/null) PSF Grants: When PyCon 2020 was cancelled, the PSF paused its Grants Program until we can find virtual options and other ways to support events, as well as fully understand the PSF’s financial situation.
