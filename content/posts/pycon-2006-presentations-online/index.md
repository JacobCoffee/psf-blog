Some of the [presentations from PyCon 2006](http://www.python.org/pycon/2006/papers/) are now available from www.python.org. Unfortunately not all of the authors have made their presentations available, but about half of the presentations are there.

If you presented a talk at PyCon and want to have your slides added to the archive, please e-mail them to (webmaster at python.org). HTML is preferred and PDF is OK; PowerPoint or OpenOffice presentations will also be accepted.

\-- Andrew Kuchling, chair, PyCon 2006.
