ADDISON, TX, November 30, 2006 - PyCon 2007, the fifth annual conference of the Python community, will take place February 23-25 at the Dallas/Addison Marriott Quorum hotel. The keynote speakers will include Ivan Krstic, from the One Laptop Per Child project; Adele Goldberg, a developer of Smalltalk; Robert M. Lefkowitz, an expert on the use of open source in business; and Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python.

PyCon annually attracts hundreds of attendees interested in the open-source Python language, ranging from novice programmers to developers of the language core. This year's conference will include a record sixty-four sessions, covering the use of Python in a broad range of contexts, such as web development, testing, and cross-language integration; case studies in industry, science, and education; and Python implementations for the Java and .NET platforms.

The program will also include intensive half-day tutorials, impromptu Open Space talks, Birds-of-a-Feather topical gatherings, and the ever-popular five-minute Lightning Talks. One new feature this year will be the Python Lab, a collaborative, hands-on problem-solving environment. Following the conference, many developers will stay for Sprints, extending the Python language and Python projects through several days of intense, cooperative coding.

PyCon is organized by members of the Python community, and made possible by the Python Software Foundation and conference sponsors.
