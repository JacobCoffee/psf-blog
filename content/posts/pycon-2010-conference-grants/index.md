At their April 12 meeting, the PSF Board approved grants for two PyCon conferences.

#### PyCon Italia

[PyCon Italia Quattro](http://www.pycon.it/) is scheduled for May 7-9 in in the old city centre of Florence. The organizers are planning three tracks of talks and anticipate more than 400 delegates. The PSF Board approved a grant of $4000US to help with conference expenses.

#### Kiwi PyCon

[Kiwi PyCon](http://nz.pycon.org/) is being organized by the [New Zealand Python Users Group (NZPUG)](http://nzpug.org/) and will be held November 20-12 in Waitangi, New Zealand. There will be a series of traditional scheduled talks, as well as BarCamp-style sessions. The PSF Board approved a grant of NZ$1,000 to defray expenses.

**Updated:** Organizers for other conferences who would like to apply for a grant should send details of their request to the board at [psf@python.org](mailto:psf@python.org).
