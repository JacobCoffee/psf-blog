Videos from this year's edition of PyCon are being uploaded and some are already available on [Python's Miro Community](http://python.mirocommunity.org/) page and on [Blip TV](http://pycon.blip.tv/). All presentations this year were of high caliber and the diversity will please everyone interested in Python. If you missed the conference, or just one or two presentations that you really wanted to see, check out the videos today!
