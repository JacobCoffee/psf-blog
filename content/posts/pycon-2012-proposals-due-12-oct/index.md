PyCon 2012, the tenth annual Python conference, is accepting proposals for talks, tutorials, and posters through 12 Oct 2011. Please submit proposals at the [PyCon speaker page](http://us.pycon.org/2012/speaker/), and then encourage someone else to prepare one, too.

#### Call for Proposals

Last year set records for attendance and talk submissions, and the conference organizers are looking forward to an even bigger and better conference this year. Anyone, whether hobbyist or professional programmer, can propose a talk, tutorial, or poster. The [call for proposals](http://us.pycon.org/2012/cfp/) includes recommendations for creating a good submission.

#### About PyCon 2012

[PyCon 2012](http://us.pycon.org/2012/) will be held in Santa Clara, California, from March 7 - 15. The conference itself runs March 9 - 11 with two days of tutorials preceding the conference, and four days of sprints following.
