The PyCon Organizing Committee will have a planning meeting at PyCon 2011 to begin the process of selecting the location for the 2014 and 2015 conferences. Any local or regional user group interested in proposing their city to host the conference should plan to have a representative at the meeting, if possible.

Email PyCon 2011 Chair Van Lindberg if you are interested in attending.

More details will be announced as soon as the time and location are decided, and a notice will be posted on the open space board at the conference in case you decide to come at the last minute.
