PyCon FR is to be held at the [Cité des sciences et de la Villette](http://fr.pycon.org/presentation) in Paris. This is the second national Python Conference in France. There is an interesting and varied program, which you can see in English [on Tarek Ziadé's blog](http://tarekziade.wordpress.com/2008/05/07/pycon-fr-is-coming-up-ask-the-program). We wish our French cousins bonne chance and look forward to seeing the sessions written up by enthusiastic delegates.
