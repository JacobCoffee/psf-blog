The [Python Software Foundation](https://python.org/psf-landing) [Packaging Working Group](https://www.python.org/psf/committees/#packaging-work-group) has applied for and received a commitment from the [Open Technology Fund](https://www.opentech.fund/) to fulfill a contract for their [Core Infrastructure Fund](https://www.opentech.fund/funds/core-infrastructure-fund/). [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) is a foundational component of the [Python](https://python.org/) ecosystem and broader computer software and technology landscape. This project aims to improve the security and accessibility of PyPI for all users worldwide, whether they are direct users like project maintainers and [`pip install`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)ers or indirect users. The impact of this work will be highly visible and improve crucial features of the service. We plan to begin the project in January 2019. Because of the size of the project, funding has been allocated to secure one or more contractors to complete the development, testing, verification, and assist in the rollout of necessary features. Register Interest To receive notification when our Request for Information period closes and the Request for Proposals period opens, please [register your interest here](https://goo.gl/forms/Jx5aXUhwSgzqjGtl2).

## What is the Request for Information period?

A Request for Information (RFI) is a process intended to allow us (The Python Software Foundation) and potential contractors to openly share information to improve the scope and definition of the project at hand. We hope that it will help potential contractors better understand the work to be completed and develop better specified proposals. Additionally we hope that the open nature of our RFI will expose the project to multiple perspectives and potentially help shape the direction for some choices in the project. The Request for Information period opens today, October 30, 2018, and is scheduled to close **November 13, 2018**. After the RFI period closes, we will use the results of the process to prepare and open a Request for Proposals to solicit proposals from contractors to complete the work.

## More Information

The full version of our Request for Information document can be found [here](https://github.com/python/request-for/blob/master/2019-Q1-PyPI/RFI.md).

## Participate!

Our RFI will be conducted on the [Python Community Discussion Forum](https://discuss.python.org/c/python-software-foundation/psf-pypi-rfi-q1-2019). Participants will need to create an account in order to propose new topics of discussion or respond to existing topics. All discussions will remain public and available for review by potential proposal authors who do not wish to or cannot create an account to participate directly.
