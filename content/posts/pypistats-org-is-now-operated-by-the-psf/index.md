For a little over six years [pypistats.org](http://pypistats.org/) has been maintained and operated by [Christopher Flynn](https://flynn.gg/) on a volunteer basis. After a recent [extended outage](https://github.com/psf/pypistats.org/issues/82) made clear the importance of this service to the Python community, and in coordination with Christopher, the Python Software Foundation (PSF) has adopted the project into our GitHub organization and migrated the service to run from our infrastructure.

So what has changed? As far as the day-to-day operations of the service goes the PSF Infrastructure Team will now make sure that [pypistats.org](http://pypistats.org/)’s backing infrastructure, costs, and domain registration are all maintained. Otherwise, there is no material change to the service. The project remains [open source](https://github.com/psf/pypistats.org) and community maintained. We are appreciative that Christopher has stated his intention to stay on as maintainer of the project and we welcome the community to get involved. We're also grateful to Christopher for his long-term volunteer contribution maintaining this service! As an organization, we are excited to have the opportunity to support pypistats.org and ensure it remains available to the community. Stories like this –under-resourced, but highly depended upon services– are not a new story for the open source community, and we are glad that this story had a positive outcome. The PSF’s Infrastructure Team is excited to be in a place to adopt services like these into our burgeoning community infrastructure along with services like the [PyLadiesCon Portal](https://portal.pyladies.com/) and [memory.python.org](http://memory.python.org/). This new community infrastructure, supported by [AWS Open Source](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/aws-promotional-credits-open-source-projects/) via their credits program, is backed by the same tooling that delivers [pypi.org](http://pypi.org/), [python.org](http://python.org/), and [us.pycon.org](http://us.pycon.org/) along with many other PSF hosted services. We look forward to sharing more in the coming months– not only what we're up to but also how you can get involved!
