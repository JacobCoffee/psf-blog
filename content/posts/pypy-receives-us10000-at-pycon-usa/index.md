The [PyPy](http://pypy.org/) Project received US$10,000 from the Python Software Foundation at the 2011 USA Python Conference in recognition for the speed with which the project has matured. Jesse Noller officiated, and gave them the check on behalf of the PSF. You can read their response on the [PyPy status blog](http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2011/03/thank-you-to-psf.html). We would like to congratulate them on their success and wish them well!
