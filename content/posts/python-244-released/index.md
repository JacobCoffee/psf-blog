Today release manager Anthony Baxter announced:

> On behalf of the Python development team and the Python community, I'm happy to announce the release of Python 2.4.4.
> 
> Python 2.4.4 is a bug-fix release. While Python 2.5 is the latest version of Python, we're making this release for people who are still running Python 2.4. This is the final planned release from the Python 2.4 series. Future maintenance releases will be in the 2.5 series, beginning with 2.5.1.

The new release can be downloaded from [the Python 2.4.4 page](http://www.python.org/2.4.4/).
