Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a global program that offers post-secondary students an opportunity to be paid for contributing to an open source project over a three-month period. Since 2005, the Python Software Foundation (PSF) has served as an "umbrella organization" to a variety of Python-related projects, as well as sponsoring projects related to the development of the Python language.
