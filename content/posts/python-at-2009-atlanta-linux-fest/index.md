We should all give Brandon Rhodes a hearty "Thanks!" for doing a great job representing Python at the [Atlanta Linux Fest](http://atlantalinuxfest.org/) on September 19th. You can read [Brandon's account of the day](http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2009/python-at-atlanta-linux-fest/) for more details and his advice to anyone planning similar outreach activities.
