The Python development team has launched a new blog.

> [Python Insider](http://blog.python.org/) is the official blog of the Python core development team. It will provide a way for people who don't follow the mailing list to get an overview of topics discussed there, and especially to learn about changes in store for Python.

[The announcement](http://blog.python.org/2011/03/welcome-to-python-insider.html) includes details about how to subscribe to the blog through its RSS feed, email, and Twitter.
