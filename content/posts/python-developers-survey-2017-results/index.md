At the end of 2017, the Python Software Foundation, together with JetBrains, conducted an official **Python Developers Survey**. We set out to identify the latest trends and gather insight into how the Python development world looks today. **Over 9,500 developers from almost 150 countries** participated to help us map out an accurate landscape of the Python community. We are super excited to share the results of the survey with you!

We hope the survey findings will help us better understand the current state of the Python developer community and answer some potential questions. Included in the survey results is information about the most popular types of Python development, trending frameworks, libraries and tools, additional languages used together with Python, adoption rates of different Python versions, and gain many other insights into the world of Python. We couldn’t include all the potential findings in the report. Therefore If you have specific unanswered questions please send them to us and we’ll dig into the data for an answer. Or if you want to delve into the data yourself, we’re also sharing the [raw survey data](http://tbd/), which anyone can use to arrive at their own conclusions and generate additional findings. If you do go the extra step and dive into the survey data, we’d be interested to learn about your findings! Please share them on Twitter or on other social media by tagging [@jetbrains](https://twitter.com/jetbrains)‏ and [@ThePSF](https://twitter.com/ThePSF) with the hashtag #pythondevsurvey2017. We’re also open to any suggestions and feedback related to the survey so we can run an even better one next time. Huge thanks to all the participants of the survey and to the amazing team at PSF and JetBrains that worked hard to make this happen!
