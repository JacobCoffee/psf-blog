In the fall of 2018, the Python Software Foundation together with JetBrains conducted the official annual Python Developers Survey for the second time. Much like the [previous survey](https://www.jetbrains.com/research/python-developers-survey-2017/), we set out to identify the latest trends and gather insight into how the world of Python development looks . Over twenty thousand developers from more than 150 different countries participated last year to help us map out an accurate, up-to-date landscape of the Python community. That is more than twice as many Python users participating in 2018 as in 2017. We are super-excited to share the results of the survey with you! [View the results of Python Developers Survey 2018!](https://www.jetbrains.com/research/python-developers-survey-2018/) We hope the survey findings will help all of us better understand the current state of the Python developer community, see the big picture, and answer some potential questions. Find out about the most popular types of Python development, trending frameworks, libraries and tools, additional languages used together with Python, adoption rates of different Python versions, and gain many other insights into the world of Python. We couldn’t include all the potential findings into the report without bloating it. If you have specific questions that are unanswered, [send them to us](mailto:surveys@python.org) and we’ll dig into the data for an answer. Or if you want to delve into the data yourself, we’re also sharing the [raw survey data](https://www.jetbrains.com/research/python-developers-survey-2018/#methodology), which anyone can use to arrive at their own conclusions and additional findings. We’re excited to see and share your findings! Please share them on twitter or other social media mentioning [@jetbrains](https://twitter.com/jetbrains)‏ and [@ThePSF](https://twitter.com/ThePSF) with the **#pythondevsurvey** hashtag. We’re open to any suggestions and feedback related to the survey so we can run an even better one next time. Huge thanks to all the participants of the survey and to the amazing team at PSF and JetBrains that worked hard to make this happen!
