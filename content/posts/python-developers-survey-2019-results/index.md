We are excited to share the results of the third official Python Developers Survey conducted by the Python Software Foundation with the help of JetBrains. More than 24,000 Python users from over 150 countries took part in the survey this past November. With the help of the data collected, we are able to present the summarized results, identify the latest trends, and create a Python developer profile. [View the results of Python Developers Survey 2019!](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/python-developers-survey-2019/) The survey results cover a broad list of topics. Some of the key things you may learn from the report include: main motivations for Python usage, current popular frameworks, libraries, tools and languages, and many other insights. In all likelihood, there are plenty of potential findings that were not included in the report. If you have specific questions that are unanswered, [send them to us](sendto:surveys@python.org) and we’ll dig into the data for additional analysis. You also have the opportunity to delve deeper into the [raw survey data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GW86M_QLFOA2KyeWeb8hzBj_RqQIXmAU) and uncover your own amazing facts. We’ll be delighted to learn about your findings! Please share them on Twitter or other social media, mentioning [@jetbrains](https://twitter.com/jetbrains)‏ and [@ThePSF](https://twitter.com/thepsf) with the #pythondevsurvey hashtag. We’re also very open to any suggestions and feedback related to this survey which could help us run an even better one next time. Feel free to open issues [here](https://github.com/python/python-dev-survey/issues) with any comments or questions. Many thanks to everyone who participated in the survey and helped us map an accurate landscape of the Python community!
