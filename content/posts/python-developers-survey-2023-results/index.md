We are excited to share [the results of the seventh official annual Python Developers Survey](https://jb.gg/vvtizf). This survey is done yearly as a collaborative effort between the Python Software Foundation and [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/). Responses were collected from November 2023 through February 2024. This year, we kept the response period open longer to facilitate as much global representation as possible. More than 25,000 Python developers and enthusiasts from almost 200 countries and regions participated in the survey to reveal the current state of the language and the ecosystem around it.  

**Check out the [survey results](https://jb.gg/vvtizf)!**  

The survey aims to map the Python landscape and covers the following topics:  

-   General Python usage
-   Purpose for using Python
-   Python versions
-   Frameworks and Libraries
-   Cloud Platforms
-   Data science
-   Development tools
-   Python packaging
-   Demographics

We encourage you to check out the [methodology](https://lp.jetbrains.com/python-developers-survey-2023/#methodology) and the [raw data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lbekmGU40UNFrUrc9YvB6msDvYYETgHa?usp=share_link) for this year's Python Developers Survey, as well as those from past years ([2022](https://lp.jetbrains.com/python-developers-survey-2022/), [2021](https://lp.jetbrains.com/python-developers-survey-2021/), [2020](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/python-developers-survey-2020), [2019](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/python-developers-survey-2019/), [2018](https://www.jetbrains.com/research/python-developers-survey-2018/), and [2017](https://www.jetbrains.com/research/python-developers-survey-2017/)). We would love to hear about what you learn by digging into the numbers! Share your results and comments with us on social media by mentioning JetBrains ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/jetbrains), [X](https://twitter.com/jetbrains)) and the PSF ([Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@ThePSF), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/thepsf), [X](https://x.com/ThePSF)) using the #pythondevsurvey hashtag. Based on the feedback we received last year, we made adjustments to the 2023 survey- so we welcome suggestions and feedback that could help us improve again for next year!
