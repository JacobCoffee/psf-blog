We are excited to announce the results of the sixth official annual Python Developers Survey. This work is done each year as a collaborative effort between the Python Software Foundation and JetBrains. Late last year, more than 23,000 Python developers and enthusiasts from almost 200 countries/regions participated in the survey to reveal the current state of the language and the ecosystem around it. (Spoiler alert: Many people are using Python, and 51% are using it for both work AND personal projects.) [https://lp.jetbrains.com/python-developers-survey-2022/](https://lp.jetbrains.com/python-developers-survey-2022/) We know the whole Python community finds this work useful. From Luciana Abud, product manager for Visual Studio Code, “Our teams at Microsoft are truly grateful to the Python Software Foundation and JetBrains for orchestrating the Python Developers Survey! The insights we gain allows us to take a data-driven approach to help with prioritizing feature development, addressing pain points, enhancing usability and anticipating future needs. This survey is invaluable in shaping our approach and continuously improving the Python development experience within the VS Code ecosystem!”

We’d love to hear how you use these numbers, so please share your thoughts on social media, mentioning [@jetbrains](https://twitter.com/jetbrains) and [@ThePSF](https://fosstodon.org/@ThePSF) with the #pythondevsurvey hashtag. We are also open to any suggestions and feedback related to this survey which could help us run an even better one next time.
