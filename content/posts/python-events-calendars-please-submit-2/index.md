### Introduction

  
As some of you may know, the PSF has a team of volunteers who are maintaining a set of central Python event calendars. We currently have two calendars in place:  

-   [**Python Events Calendar**](https://www.python.org/events/python-events/) - meant for conferences and larger gatherings focusing on Python or a related technology (in whole or in part)

-   [**Python User Group Calendar**](https://www.python.org/events/python-user-group/) - meant for user group events and other smaller local events

The calendars are displayed on [http://pycon.org/](http://pycon.org/) and also on the new [https://python.org/](https://python.org/) website at [https://www.python.org/events/python-events/](https://www.python.org/events/python-events/) and [https://www.python.org/events/python-user-group/](https://www.python.org/events/python-user-group/).  
  
You can subscribe to the calendars using iCal and RSS feeds and also embed the calendar widgets on your sites. We have also added a Twitter feed [@PythonEvents](https://twitter.com/PythonEvents) to get immediate updates whenever a new event is added. Please see our wiki page for details: [https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEventsCalendar](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEventsCalendar) The calendars are open to the world-wide Python community, so you can have local user group events, as well as regional and international conference events added to the calendars.

### News

  
Looking back on 2014, the calendars have proven to be a great tool for the Python community to connect, with **more th****an 60 conferences** and **more than a hundred of user group events** listed.  
  
We would therefore like to **encourage everyone to submit their 2015 events**, so that the Python community can get a better overview over what's happening in Python land.

### Adding Events

  
Please see the instructions at [https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEventsCalendar#Available\_Calendars](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEventsCalendar#Available_Calendars) for details on how to submit an event. We've made it really easy for you: just need to send an email to our team address using the email template we provide for this. Thanks. *PS: Please help spread the word about the calendars - we'll all benefit from knowing more about Python events happening around the world. Feel free to forward this posting to your local user groups and conference teams. Thanks.*
