Python project contributors and student enthusiasts, mark your calendars: Google Summer of Code applications open soon! [Google Summer of Code](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014) is an annual, global program pairing student developers with mentors in open source projects for paid summer internships. You can learn more about this year's Google Summer of Code [here](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014).  

# Python projects

Python serves as an umbrella organization for around a dozen open source Python projects each year. This year, the following projects are participating:

-   [CPython](http://python.org/): core Python and the standard library
-   [GNU Mailman](http://list.org/): the ubiquitous mailing list package
-   [Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/): a distributed source control management tool
-   [BinPy](http://binpy.github.io/): a platform for building circuit-based applications or logical games
-   [Vispy](http://vispy.org/): high-performance interactive visualizations
-   [TARDIS-SN](http://tardis.readthedocs.org/): supernova radiative transfer in Python
-   [SunPy](http://www.sunpy.org/): Python for solar physics
-   [Scrapy](http://scrapy.org/): a fast, high-level screen scraping and web crawling framework
-   [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano): an optimizing compiler for numpy.ndarray and scipy.sparse matrix
-   [Kivy](http://kivy.org/): a library for making cross-platform, multi-touch apps
-   [MNE-Python](http://martinos.org/mne/stable/index.html): a software package for processing MEG and EEG data
-   [scikit-image](http://scikit-image.org/): a collection of algorithms for image processing
-   [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/): a Python module for machine learning
-   [PyDy](http://pydy.org/): a package for studying multibody dynamics with Python
-   [SciPy and NumPy](http://www.scipy.org/): open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering
-   [AstroPy](http://www.astropy.org/): a community Python library for astronomy

# Students

Google Summer of Code is a paid summer internship program for college/university students who will be 18 years of age or older on April 21, 2014. Participating in Google Summer of Code is a great way to develop real-world software engineering skills while giving back to an open source Python project you love. Read more about eligibility in the [FAQ](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2014/help_page). If you are interested in participating in Google Summer of Code under the Python umbrella, it's time to start exploring potential projects and practicing the tools of open source development:  

1.  Read the [Python Google Summer of Code guidelines](http://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode/2014).
2.  [Review this year's projects and their idea pages](https://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode/2014#project_ideas).
3.  Start practicing the tools of open source development, including:  
    -   IRC
    -   a revision control system like git or svn
    -   the diff and patch utilities
    -   bug trackers

If you've never used some of these tools before, don't worry! You have plenty of time to practice. A good resource for getting familiar with these tools is the [OpenHatch training missions](http://openhatch.org/missions/).

## Important deadlines

-   **March 10**: Student application period opens.
-   **March 21**: Student application deadline.
-   **April 21**: Accepted student proposals announced.

Note that the best way to boost your chances of being accepted for Google Summer of Code is to start contributing to a project **before** you apply. If you have questions about how to get started or just want some friendly encouragement, visit the OpenHatch project and [say hello](https://openhatch.org/wiki/Contact).
