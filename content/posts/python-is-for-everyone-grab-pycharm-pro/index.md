So far [this year’s PSF fundraising campaign](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/11/python-is-for-everyone-join-in-psf-year.html) has been a truly inspiring demonstration of the Python community's generosity, strength, and solidarity. We set a special 🥧 themed goal of $314,159.26 (it’s [the year of Python 3.14](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3140/)!), and with your support, we are already at 93% of that goal—WOW!! Thank you to every single person who has already donated: you have our deep gratitude, and we are committed to making every dollar count.

🚨 New target alert: If we hit our goal of $100Kπ- we are going to release a nice video AND we are going to set a new goal, as well as an additional ***super stretch*** goal. [Can you chip in to get us there](http://donate.python.org)? We’re confident that with your contributions and support we can reach those new heights. Because Python is for everyone, thanks to you!

## If you already donated, you’re already a PSF member, AND you already grabbed PyCharm at 30% off (look at you, you exemplary supporter!🏆) you can:

-   **Share your Python story with a call to action:** We invite you to share your personal Python, PyCon, or PSF story. What impact has it made in your life, in your community, in your career? Share your story in a blog post or on your social media platform of choice and add a link to [donate.python.org](http://donate.python.org).
-   **Ask your employer to sponsor:** If your company is using Python to build its products and services, check to see if they already sponsor the PSF on our [Sponsors page](https://www.python.org/psf/sponsors/). If not, reach out to your organization's internal decision-makers and impress on them just how important it is for us to power the future of Python together, and send them our [sponsor prospectus](https://www.python.org/sponsors/application/).
