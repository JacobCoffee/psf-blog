The [Python Software Foundation](http://python.org/psf) (PSF) is the charitable organization behind Python, dedicated to advancing, supporting, and protecting the Python programming language and the community that sustains it. That mission and cause are more than just words we believe in. Our tiny but mighty team works hard to deliver the projects and services that allow Python to be the thriving, independent, community-driven language it is today. Some of what the PSF does includes producing [PyCon US](https://us.pycon.org), hosting the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](http://pypi.org), supporting [5 Developers-in-Residence](https://www.python.org/psf/developersinresidence/), [maintaining critical community infrastructure](https://www.python.org/psf/about/), and more. Python is for teaching, learning, playing, researching, exploring, creating, working– the list goes on and on and on! Support this year's fundraiser with your donations and memberships to help the PSF, the Python community, and the language stay strong and sustainable. **Because Python is for everyone, thanks to you.**

### There are two direct ways to join through [donate.python.org](http://donate.python.org):

-   **Donate directly to the PSF!** Your donation is a direct way to support and power the future of the Python programming language and community you love. Every donation makes a difference, and we work hard to make a little go a long way.
-   **Become a PSF Supporting Member!** When you sign up as a Supporting Member of the PSF, you become a part of the PSF, are eligible to vote in PSF elections, and help us sustain our mission with your annual support.

## Highlights from 2025:

-   **Producing another wonderful PyCon US:** We welcomed 2,225 attendees for [PyCon US 2025](https://pycon.blogspot.com/2025/08/pycon-us-2025-recap-and-recordings.html)– 1,404 of whom were newcomers– at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center in beautiful downtown Pittsburgh. PyCon US 2025 was packed with 9 days of content, education, and networking for the Python community, including 6 Keynote Sessions, 91 Talks, including the Charlas Spanish track, 24 Tutorials, 20 Posters, 30+ Sprint Projects, 146 Open Spaces, and 60 Booths!
-   **Continuing to enhance Python and PyPI’s security through Developers-in-Residence:** The PSF’s PyPI Safety and Security Engineer, Mike Fiedler, has implemented new safeguards, including automation to detect expiring email domains and prevent impersonation attacks, as well as guidance for maintainers to use more secure authentication methods like WebAuthn and Trusted Publishers. The PSF’s Security Developer-in-Residence, Seth Larson, continues to lead efforts to strengthen Python’s security and transparency. His work on PEP 770 introduces standardized Software Bill-of-Materials (SBOMs) within Python packages, improving visibility into dependencies for stronger supply chain security. A [new white paper co-authored with Alpha-Omega](https://alpha-omega.dev/blog/slippery-zips-and-sticky-tar-pits-security-and-archives-white-paper-by-seth-larson-python-software-foundation/) outlines how these improvements enhance trust and measurability across the ecosystem.
-   **Adoption of [pypistats.org](http://pypistats.org):** The [PSF infrastructure team has officially adopted the operation of pypistats.org](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/08/pypistats-org-is-now-operated-by-the-psf.html), which had been run by volunteer Christopher Flynn for over six years (thank you, Christopher!). The PSF’s Infrastructure Team now handles the service’s infrastructure, costs, and domain registration– and the service itself remains open source and community-maintained.
-   **Advancing PyPI Organizations:** The rollout of [PyPI Organizations](https://docs.pypi.org/organization-accounts/) is now well underway, marking a major milestone in improving project management and collaboration across the Python ecosystem. With new Terms of Service finalized and supporting tools in place, the PSF has cleared its backlog of requests and approved thousands of organizations—including 2,409 Community and 4979 Company organizations as of today. Hundreds of these organizations have already begun adding members, transferring projects, and subscribing to the new Company tier, generating sustainable support for the PSF. We’re excited to see how teams are using these new features to better organize and maintain their projects on PyPI.
-   **Empowering the Python community through Fiscal Sponsorship:** We are proud to continue supporting our 20 fiscal sponsoree organizations with their initiatives and events all year round. The PSF provides 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status to fiscal sponsorees such as PyLadies and Pallets, and provides back office support so they can focus on their missions. Consider [donating to your favorite PSF Fiscal Sponsoree](https://linktr.ee/thepsf) and check out our [Fiscal Sponsorees page](https://www.python.org/psf/fiscal-sponsorees/) to learn more about what each of these awesome organizations is all about!
-   **Serving our community with grants:** The PSF Grants Program awarded approximately $340K to 86 grantees around the world; supporting local conferences, workshops, and community initiatives that keep Python growing and accessible to all. While we had to make [the difficult decision to pause the program early](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/08/the-psf-has-paused-our-grants-program.html) to ensure financial sustainability, we would love to reopen it as soon as possible. Your participation in this year’s fundraiser fuels that effort!
-   **Honoring community leaders:** The PSF honored three leaders with Distinguished Service Awards this year. [Ewa Jodlowska](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/03/psf-dsa-ewa-jodlowska.html) helped transform the PSF into a professional, globally supportive organization. [Thomas Wouters](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/03/dsa-thomas-wouters.html) has contributed decades of leadership, guidance, and institutional knowledge. [Van Lindberg](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/03/dsa-van-lindberg.html) provided essential legal expertise that guided the PSF through growth and governance. Their dedication has left a lasting impact on the PSF, Python, and its community. The PSF was also thrilled to recognize [Katie McLaughlin, Sarah Kuchinsky, and Rodrigo Girão Serrão with Community Service Awards](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/10/announcing-psf-community-service-award.html) (CSA) for their outstanding contributions to the Python community. Their dedication, creativity, and generosity embody the spirit of Python and strengthen our global community. We recognized Jay Miller with a CSA for his work to improve diversity, inclusion, and equity in the global Python community through founding and sustaining Black Python Devs. We also honored Matt Lebrun and Micaela Reyes with CSA's for their efforts to grow and support the Python community in the Philippines through conferences, meetups, and volunteer programs.
-   **Finding strength in the Python community:** When the PSF shared [the news about turning down a NSF grant](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/10/NSF-funding-statement.html), the outpouring of support from the Python community was nothing short of incredible. In just one day, you helped raise over $60K and welcomed 125 new Supporting Members- in the week after, that number jumped to $150K+ and 270+ new Supporting Members! A community-led matching campaign and countless messages of support, solidarity, and encouragement reminded us that while some choices are tough, we never face them alone. The PSF Board & Staff are deeply moved and energized by your words, actions, and continued belief in our shared mission. This moment has set the stage for a record-breaking end-of-year fundraiser, and we are so incredibly grateful to be in community with each of you.
