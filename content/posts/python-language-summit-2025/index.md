The Python Language Summit 2025 occurred on May 14th in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Core developers and special guests from around the world gathered in one room for an entire day of presentations and discussions about the future of the Python programming language.

The summit was organized by Emily Morehouse and Łukasz Langa, and blog posts were written by Seth Larson. Thanks to Marie Nordin, the Community Communications Manager at the Python Software Foundation, for reviewing and editing the blog posts.

This year’s set of presentations was heavily themed towards the new "free-threading" work, featuring multiple discussions about contention, concurrency, and governance.
