We’re excited to announce that plans are underway for our end-of-the-year 2020 fundraising campaign launching on November 23rd and ending on December 31st!

  

In the past, we’ve worked successfully with organizations such as [JetBrains](https://www.python.org/psf/donations/2019-q2-drive/) who donated 100% of the profits from the sale of PyCharm to the PSF. The theme this year is geared toward education. We'll be actively supporting Python educators by collaborating with authors, trainers, and education companies that offer their services all over the world. The goal for the campaign is $30,000 and the funds raised will help benefit the PSF, our community, and those who educate Pythonistas worldwide.

  

In order to keep this fundraiser manageable for our staff, we have a limited number of slots available. For those interested in working with us, we’ve created an [application for participation.](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/psf_python_ed) Through the application process, we hope to have products and services throughout the world.

  

100% of PyCon US net proceeds fund the PSF’s ongoing grant-giving and operating expenses. The cancellation of PyCon US, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, financially impacted our ability to continue regular operations. This affects our ability to maintain core Python infrastructure including the Python Package Index, the grants program, and other community support.

  

This fundraiser is critically important and the money raised will help the PSF fund the tools and initiatives that Pythonistas use everyday.

### How does it work?

Participating companies offer one (or more) product or service during the time period of the campaign, with all or a portion (20-50%) of the proceeds going to the PSF. Including a discount is optional.
