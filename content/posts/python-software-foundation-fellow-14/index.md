We have added you to our Fellow roster [online](https://www.python.org/psf/members/). The above members have contributed to the Python ecosystem by teaching Python, creating education material, contributing to circuitpython, contributing to and maintaining packaging, organizing Python events and conferences, starting Python communities in their home countries, and overall being great mentors in our community. Each of them continues to help make Python more accessible around the world. To learn more about the new Fellow members, check out their links above.  
Let's continue to recognize Pythonistas all over the world for their impact on our community. The criteria for Fellow members is available online: [https://www.python.org/psf/fellows/](https://www.python.org/psf/fellows/). If you would like to nominate someone to be a PSF Fellow, please send a description of their Python accomplishments and their email address to psf-fellow at python.org. We are accepting nominations for quarter 2 through May 20, 2020.
