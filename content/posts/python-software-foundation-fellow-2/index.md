Thank you for your continued contributions. We have added you to our Fellow roster [online](https://www.python.org/psf/members/).

The above members help support the Python ecosystem by contributing to CPython, contributing to the PyLadies community, maintaining Python libraries, creating educational material, translating courses, organizing Python events and conferences, starting Python communities in local regions, and overall being great mentors in our community. Each of them continues to help make Python more accessible around the world. To learn more about the new Fellow members, check out their links above.

Let's continue to recognize Pythonistas all over the world for their impact on our community.
