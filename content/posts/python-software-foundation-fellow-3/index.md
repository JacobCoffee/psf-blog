Thank you for your continued contributions. We have added you to our Fellow roster [online](https://www.python.org/psf/members/).

The above members help support the Python ecosystem by contributing to CPython, contributing to the PyLadies community, maintaining Python libraries, creating educational material, improving UX/UI for our infrastructure, organizing Python events and conferences, starting Python communities in local regions, and overall being great mentors in our community. Each of them continues to help make Python more accessible around the world. To learn more about the new Fellow members, check out their links above.

Let's continue to recognize Pythonistas all over the world for their impact on our community. The criteria for Fellow members is available online: [https://www.python.org/psf/fellows/](https://www.python.org/psf/fellows/). If you would like to nominate someone to be a PSF Fellow, please send a description of their Python accomplishments and their email address to psf-fellow at python.org. We are accepting nominations for quarter 2 through May 20, 2021 (Q1 cut-off has already passed!).
