Congratulations! Thank you for all of the contributions you continue to make. We have added you to our Fellow roster online.  
  
The PSF Fellow Work Group was established in July of 2017. This is the first set of Fellows the Work Group has reviewed and voted on. Since we are a new group, we spent a few months establishing policies and criteria.  
  
The work group voted to review nominees 4 times a year:

-   Q1: January to the end of March (01/01 - 31/03) Cut-off for nominations will be February 20. New fellows will be announced before March 31.
-   Q2: April to the end of June (01/04 - 30/06) Cut-off for quarter two will be May 20. New fellows will be announced before June 30.
-   Q3: July to the end of September (01/07 - 30/09) Cut-off for quarter three will be August 20. New fellows will be announced before end of September. 
-   Q4: October to the end of December (01/10 - 31/12) Cut-off for quarter four will be November 20. New fellows will be announced before December 31. 

In addition to the schedule, we also voted on the following criteria:

-    For those who have served the Python community by creating and/or maintaining various engineering/design contributions, the following statement should be true:

-    Nominated Person has served the Python community by making available code, tests, documentation, or design, either in a Python implementation or in a Python ecosystem project, that 1) shows technical excellence, 2) is an example of software engineering principles and best practices, and 3) has achieved widespread usage or acclaim. 

-   For those who have served the Python community by coordinating, organizing, teaching, writing, and evangelizing, the following statement should be true:

-    Nominated Person has served the Python community through extraordinary efforts in organizing Python events, publicly promoting Python, and teaching and coordinating others. Nominated Person's efforts have shown leadership and resulted in long-lasting and substantial gains in the number and quality of Python users, and have been widely recognized as being above and beyond normal volunteering. 

-   If someone is not accepted to be a fellow in the quarter they were nominated for, they will remain an active nominee for 1 year for future consideration. 
-   It is suggested/recommended that the nominee have wide Python community involvement. Examples would be (not a complete list - just examples): 

-   Someone who has received a Community Service Award or Distinguished Service Award
-   A developer that writes (more than one) documentation/books/tutorials for wider audience .
-   Someone that helps translate (more than one) documentation/books/tutorials for better inclusivity.
-    An instructor that teaches Python related tutorials in various regions .
-   Someone that helps organize local meet ups and also helps organize a regional conference.

-    Nominees should be aware of the Python community’s Code of Conduct and should have a record of fostering the community. 
-   Sitting members of the PSF Board of Directors can be nominated if they meet the above criteria.

If you would like to nominate someone to be a PSF Fellow, please send a description of their Python accomplishments to psf-fellow at python.org. If you send in your nomination before November 20, it will be considered in Q4. More info is available here.   
  
We are still looking for a few more voting members to join the Work Group. If you are a PSF Fellow and would like to join, please write to psf-fellow at python.org.
