May 1, 2008 Linux Journal announced their 2008 [Readers' Choice Awards](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/10065) today, and we are happy to say that Python won the Favorite Scripting Language category with 28.9% of the vote. PHP, Bash and Perl (in that order) won honorable mentions. Thanks to everyone who took the time to register their votes. Python's popularity does seem to be climbing this year, as attendance at the recent Chicago PyCon confirmed with a 77% increase in attendance. Let's hope that leads to career opportunities for Python users!
