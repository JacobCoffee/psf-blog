Today the PSF is pleased to announce a redesigned version of [www.python.org](http://www.python.org).

The new page design was created by Tim Parkin of [Pollenation Internet](http://www.pollenation.net). It uses modern CSS for page styling, making it possible to choose between normal and large-font versions of the site, and suppressing the page headers and sidebars in the printed version. Try previewing the printed version of a page to see the effect.

Pages are now closer to being valid XHTML 1.0, though not quite -- there was a *lot* of content to convert. Much conversion work was done by the participants in the pydotorg sprint at PyCon 2006.

We welcome comments and bug reports for the new site. Please see the ['About the website'](http://www.python.org/about/website/) page for instructions on creating a new problem ticket. You can also send e-mail to the address <webmaster at python.org>.
