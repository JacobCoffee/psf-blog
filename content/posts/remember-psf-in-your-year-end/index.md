We ask members of the Python community to please keep the Python Software Foundation in mind in your "year end giving".

The PSF is the 501(c)3 non-profit organization that holds and protects the intellectual property rights behind Python. We deal with the licensing, contribution agreements, and legal requirements of copyright and trademark in order to keep Python open and free of legal claims.

The PSF also:

-   Provides the financial backing that makes [PyCon](http://us.pycon.org) possible.
-   Funds special projects such as the website redesign and the current [Python Advocacy Coordinator](http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonAdvocacyCoordinator) experiment.
-   Funds [grants](http://www.python.org/psf/grants/).
-   Responds to legal queries about the license, trademarks, or US export control registration, owns/renews the key Python domain names, and other such administrative chores.

See [our donation page](http://www.python.org/psf/donations/) for instructions on donating via credit card, checks, wire transfers, or PayPal.

Donations are tax deductible for US citizens and for any business where donations or sponsorship can be considered pre-tax business expenses.

Businesses can also consider becoming [a sponsor member of the PSF](http://www.python.org/psf/sponsorship/) or [a sponsor of PyCon 2007](http://us.pycon.org/TX2007/HowToSponsor).
