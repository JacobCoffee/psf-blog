As we previously announced, nominations for the Python Software Foundation's board of directors are open, and they will be accepted through Friday May 1. Please see our [original announcement](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/04/run-for-board-of-directors.html) as well as [details about the wiki here](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/04/board-of-directions-nomination.html). Candidates for the 11 seats on the board are found at [https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSoftwareFoundation/BoardCandidates2015](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSoftwareFoundation/BoardCandidates2015). Those interested in running for one of the positions can add themselves, and per Section 5.14 of our [bylaws](https://www.python.org/psf/bylaws/), all candidates must disclose their affiliations.
