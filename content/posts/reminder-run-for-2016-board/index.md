[As we announced last week](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2016/04/run-for-2016-board-of-directors.html), the Python Software Foundation is seeking candidates for this year's directors. Nominations are open now until the end of May 15 [Anywhere on Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth). Candidates from anywhere in the world are welcome; members of the Board do not need to be residents or citizens of the United States. There are 11 directors, elected annually for a term of one year. Directors are unpaid volunteers. The list of nominees is on the PSF wiki: [**Candidates in the 2016 PSF Board Election**.](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSoftwareFoundation/BoardCandidates2016) If have a passion for the Python language and community, add yourself to the list! If someone you know would make a great member of the board, ask if they'd like you to nominate them.
