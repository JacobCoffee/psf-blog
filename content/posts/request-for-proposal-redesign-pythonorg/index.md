The main Python site at [www.python.org](http://www.python.org/) was redesigned in 2005-2006 -- over six years ago. It's time for a redesign, to improve the organization of the site and its appearance, and to simplify the task for the volunteers who maintain the content. The PSF would therefore like fund the design and implementation of a new look and architecture for python.org. The web development landscape has also changed a lot since 2006, and we look forward to seeing what this community can produce. The [Request for Proposal for the python.org redesign](http://pythonorg-redesign.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) has been published on readthedocs.org. Questions and comments can be e-mailed to the psf-redesign mailing list at [psf-redesign at python.org](mailto:psf-redesign@python.org). Proposals are due by July 21st 2012, two months from today. The RFP was initially drafted by Jesse Noller, and feedback from the python.org site maintainers was incorporated by Andrew Kuchling.
