Currently Python's bug/patch tracker is hosted on [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=5470). While it has served its purpose over the years, the decision has been made that it is time to move on to another tracker. The Python Software Foundation's Infrastructure Committee has been charged with selecting a new tracker to use for Python's development. To do this, the committee is asking for volunteers in setting up test trackers. Candidate trackers are to load data from a dump of the current bug data from SourceForge. In this way, the committee can properly evaluate the plethora of trackers that are available. If you think you can help by installing and maintaining a test tracker for the duration of the evaluation period, please see the [detailed request](http://wiki.python.org/moin/CallForTrackers) on the Python wiki. Thanks to anyone who is able to help out.
