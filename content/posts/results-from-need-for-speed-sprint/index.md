The Need For Speed sprint in Reykjavik, Iceland, is winding down today, and Steve Holden has posted [a summary of the results](http://holdenweb.blogspot.com/2006/05/need-for-speed-wrap-up.html). The gains are impressive:

-   Several string methods such as `.find()` and `.replace()` are now much faster; some methods are up to 4 times or even 25 times faster! (Work by Andrew Dalke and Fredrik Lundh.)
-   Exception handling is now 30% faster than in Python 2.4. (Work by Georg Brandl, Richard Jones, and Sean Reifschneider.)
-   The `struct` module now precompiles format strings and is about 20% faster. (Work by Martin Blais, Bob Ippolito.)
-   The interpreter can be built using Microsoft Visual Studio 8's profile-driven optimizations. (Work by Kristjan Jonsson, Richard Tew.)
-   Georg Brandl and Jack Diederich began a rewrite of the `decimal` module into C, laying the foundations for a Summer of Code student to complete the work.

And there's even more! A complete list of the improvements made at the sprint are recorded in [the Successes wiki page](http://wiki.python.org/moin/NeedForSpeed/Successes).

Thanks to the participants, to CCP Games for their support, and to the sprint's sponsor, EWT LLC.
