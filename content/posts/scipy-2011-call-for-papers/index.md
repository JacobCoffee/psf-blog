[SciPy 2011](http://conference.scipy.org/scipy2011/), the 10th Python in Science conference, will be held July 11 - 16, 2011, in Austin, TX.

At this conference, novel applications and breakthroughs made in the pursuit of science using Python are presented. The conference is preceded by two days of tutorials, during which community experts provide training on several scientific Python packages.

Potential speakers are invited to take part by submitting a talk abstract at the [conference website](http://conference.scipy.org/scipy2011/papers.php). Associated papers (optional) are included in the peer-reviewed conference proceedings, to be published online.

This year will also feature two specialized tracks, whose express aim it is to open up SciPy to the broader Python community. The first track is **Python in Data Science** chaired by Peter Wang, and the second is entitled **Python and Core Technologies** chaired by Anthony Scopatz.
