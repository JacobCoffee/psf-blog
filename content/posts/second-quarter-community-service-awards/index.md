The Foundation tries to recognize those whose assistance has been significant in its growth and development as well as its day-to-day operations. This quarter's Community Service Award winners are two particularly noteworthy examples.

**Stephan Deibel** Stephan was last year's outgoing chairman after four years in harness. This year Stephan has stepped down as a director, after helping to ensure that the Foundation's bylaws were reorganized. Stephan developed pythonology.com to promote Python, and his work as founder of [Wingware](http://wingware.com/) and a developer of the Wing IDE has also had a significant impact.

Sean Reifschneider Sean has master-minded the PyCOn networking every time it's worked, and without the support of this always helpful and reliably competent [tummy.com](http://tummy.com/) director our conferences simply would not have been the same.

Our thanks and congratulations go to both these recipients.
