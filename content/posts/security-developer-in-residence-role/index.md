We are excited to announce the continuation of Seth Larson’s work in the Security Developer-in-Residence role through the end of 2024 thanks to continued support from [Alpha-Omega](https://alpha-omega.dev). (This six month extension is intended to align the renewal period for this role with the calendar year going forward).  

The first year of the Security Developer-in-Residence initiative has been a success, seeing multiple improvements to the Python ecosystem's security posture. These improvements include [authorizing the PSF as a CVE Numbering Authority](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2023/08/psf-authorized-as-cna.html), migrating the CPython release process [to an isolated hosted build platform](https://sethmlarson.dev/security-developer-in-residence-weekly-report-33), and [generating comprehensive Software Bill-of-Materials documents](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/02/software-bill-of-materials-now-available-for-cpython.html) for CPython artifacts.

Open source software security continues to evolve, this year saw new regulations for software security like the EU Cyber Resiliency Act (CRA) and evolving threats to open source like the backdoor of xz-utils.

The PSF is looking forward to continuing our investment in the security of the Python ecosystem and everyone who depends on Python software. For the remainder of 2024, priorities for Security Developer-in-Residence role include:  

-   Formalization of the [Python Security Response Team](https://www.python.org/dev/security/) (PSRT) and processes for handling vulnerability reports and fixes.
-   Developing a strategy for Software Bill-of-Materials documents and Python packages.
-   Completing the migration of the CPython release process and generation of SBOM documents for the macOS installer.
-   Continued engagement with the Python community promoting security best-practices and standards.
