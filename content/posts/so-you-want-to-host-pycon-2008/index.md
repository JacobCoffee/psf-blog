Now is a good time to start thinking about the location of PyCon 2008. This posting is a call for interested groups to begin considering and planning sites for the 2008 conference.

Dallas TX was chosen as the location of PyCon 2006 and 2007 because the [local Python user group](http://www.dfwpython.org/) prepared an excellent set of web pages [describing the proposed location](http://dfwpython.org/DfwPyConBid/HomePage).

We'll repeat this procedure for 2008: interested groups can prepare bids describing their city and suggested venue. The selection of the 2008 location might be made at the 2007 conference, or the PSF and the conference chair might choose a location after mutual consultation.

Do you have an idea for where PyCon 2008 could be held? Here's what to do:

-   Form a group of people interested in helping with the conference planning.
-   Read [the list of location requirements](http://wiki.python.org/moin/PyConPlanning/BidRequirements). This list is modelled on the Perl Foundation's venue requirements for their YAPC conferences and on past PyCon experience.
-   Consider how your location meets the requirements, and research issues such as transportation and costs.
-   Write up a bid describing your location. This bid should cover all of the areas listed in the requirements: facilities, catering, accommodations, audiovisual equipment, etc.

Feedback on the requirements is welcome; you can either e-mail me at (amk at amk.ca) or post to the [pycon-organizers mailing list](http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pycon-organizers).
