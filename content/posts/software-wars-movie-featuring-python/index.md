As the [Software Wars](http://www.indiegogo.com/SoftwareWars) indiegogo campaign comes to a close in the last 40 hours, did you know Python plays a role in the movie? Creator Keith Curtis wrote to us to mention that William Stein, creator of [Sage](http://www.sagemath.org/), is interviewed and endorses Python's use for teaching mathematics to children. There are also plans to interview others in the community, perhaps some of the children making use of Python. The creators greatly appreciate your contributions to make [Software Wars](http://www.indiegogo.com/SoftwareWars) possible!
