Last month, in addition to the election for the Board of Directors, a separate election was held asking PSF members to approve three new sponsors. Here is Ian Cordasco’s announcement of those results:

> … we had 198 voters out of 426 which is ~46.48% of the voting membership (at the time). The results are [here](https://vote.python.org/init/default/results/15). In short, **Intel** and **New Relic** both were overwhelmingly approved. **Pickaweb** less so but they still received (of the ballots cast) 56% approval (111/198).

So, according to the bylaws (Section 4.6), all three sponsors were approved! Thanks to Ian and everyone who participated. And to the new sponsors, congratulations and welcome aboard! *I would love to hear from readers. Please send feedback, comments, or blog ideas to me at [msushi@gnosis.cx](mailto:msushi@gnosis.cx).*
