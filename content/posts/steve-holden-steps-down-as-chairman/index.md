Throughout his time with the Python Software Foundation, starting as the informal chair of the first several PyCons, the Python community has enjoyed the friendly face of Steve Holden at the helm and around the community, exemplifying the open source ethos. Through his 8 years as a Director, two of which he spent as Vice Chairman, and the last four spent as Chairman of the Board, Steve's hard work and countless hours of effort have helped shape this community and foundation into the great state we have in 2012. While Steve isn't leaving the community or even the foundation, where he'll remain as a Director, he's moving on from the Chairman position earlier than planned to take some well needed personal time. As he outlines in his last post, [Swan Song](http://holdenweb.blogspot.com/2012/05/well-i-dont-really-know-where-to-begin.html), there's likely to be some surgery in his future, and we wish him all the best. On behalf of the foundation and the community, we want to thank Steve for everything he's done for us personally and for everything he's done for the Python community.
