Students can now submit their Python-related proposals for Google's 2006 Summer of Code. Please see [the Summer of Code wiki page](http://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode) for ideas and application instructions.

We're also still accepting volunteers to mentor students. The wiki page also has instructions for mentors.
