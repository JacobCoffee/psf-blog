A slate of Python-related projects has now been selected for Google's [Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/) initiative.

The Python Software Foundation (PSF) was allocated 25 projects, tying with the Apache Software Foundation for the largest number of funded proposals. The PSF's [list of the accepted projects](http://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode) is now public.

The accepted projects include 5 enhancements to the CPython interpreter or standard library, 3 [PyPy](http://codespeak.net/pypy/) projects, 3 [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org) projects, and 2 projects relating to the [Soya3D](http://www.soya3d.org) library for 3-dimensional graphics. There are also individual projects to enhance PyGame, SQLAlchemy, Python support in Eclipse, and Mailman; to port the Cells extension for object-oriented programming from Common Lisp to Python; to add automated code analysis to the [Python Package Index](http://cheeseshop.python.org); and to write a Python API for Mozilla browser plug-ins.

The PSF would like to thank everyone who helped assess and rank proposals, and all the volunteer mentors who offered to assist students with their projects.
