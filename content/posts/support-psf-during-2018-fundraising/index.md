The PSF is launching an exciting fundraising drive with a goal of raising $20,000.00 USD by May 12th. **The drive begins April 16, 2018 and concludes at PyCon on May 12th**. Your donations help the Python community worldwide by supporting sprints, meetups, community events and projects, the Python Ambassador Program, fiscal sponsorships, and of course, software development and open source projects. All of these initiatives help improve the Python community and Python tools that you use daily. The work cannot be done without the generous financial support that individuals and organizations provide us. It is easy to donate - simply click on the amount you would like to give, and enter your email address. Confirm your contribution and you will be able to pay with your PayPal account or a credit or debit card. Contributions are tax deductible for individuals and organizations in the United States. **To thank you for your financial support, we will enter you in a drawing to win the following prizes:**

-   Ticket to PyCon 2019 (1 winner)
-   Photos with Guido van Rossum at PyCon 2018 (must be present to win)
-   Lunch with Guido van Rossum at PyCon 2018 (8 winners, must be present to win)
-   Custom designed Guido T-Shirt (5 winners)
-   “I Donated” stickers
