Advocacy coordinator Jeff Rush has created some new mailing lists and resources for usergroup organizers, described in [his post to the Python Advocacy weblog](http://python-advocacy.blogspot.com/2007/06/calling-usergroup-organizers-and.html). To summarize:

-   a weblog for [usergroup event reports](http://python-groups.blogspot.com/)
-   a mailing list for usergroup organizers, group-organizers
-   an [updated list of usergroups](http://wiki.python.org/moin/LocalUserGroups) (it's in the wiki, so be sure your local group is there)

Jeff also suggests that groups can market themselves by writing articles or recording video of presentations at their meetings. Please see his post for more.
