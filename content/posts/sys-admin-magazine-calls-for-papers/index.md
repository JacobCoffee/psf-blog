Have you used Python to improve your life as a system administrator? (Yes, even system administrators are supposed to have lives). If so then Sys Admin magazine would like you to [write an article](http://www.samag.com/ed/call.htm)., and this year's December issue has scripting as its theme. The required lead time for print publications is longer than you might anticipate - see their [editorial calendar](http://www.samag.com/ed/calendar.htm), and you should also check their [author guidelines](http://www.samag.com/ed/) - so we are publishing this notice early enough to allow plenty of time for planning and writing. Let's see lots of Python articles in that issue. Fame and fortune await you, not to mention the gratitude of your fellow Pythonistas! We understand that the magazine does pay for published articles, but you should agree payment terms and amount with them in advance.
