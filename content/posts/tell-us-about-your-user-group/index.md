The Python Software Foundation is conducting an international survey of Python User Group organizers to help us better serve the large and ever-expanding Python User Group community.

The survey contains questions on user group organization, events, demographics, and growth. There are some questions with numerical answers, and while your best guess is fine, you may find it helpful to gather some statistics on your user group membership before starting the survey (example statistics include the number of active members and the size and topics for recent user group events).

We expect this survey to take around 30 minutes to complete. We appreciate your time and honesty in answering these questions.

This survey was written by [Jessica McKellar](http://jesstess.com), organizer for the [Boston Python Meetup](http://meetup.bostonpython.com), and [Jesse Noller](http://jessenoller.com/), PSF board member and PyCon chair.
