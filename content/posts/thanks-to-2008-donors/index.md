From figures supplied by the Treasurer it appears that the PSF received donations totalling $23,807.65 in 2008. The smallest donation was one cent, and the largest was $2,052. We are grateful for them all. As a non-profit it's important for the Foundation to maintain what's known as the [public support ratio](http://www.nonprofitlawblog.com/home/2006/01/public_support_.html), to retain our non-profit status.

I realize that times are hard right now, but if you are feeling at all expansive we really would be grateful to anyone who can [make a donation](http://python.org/psf/donations/), no matter what the size.

Thanks again to all contributors for your support, and thanks also to those who contributed in other ways by attending conferences, serving on committees and donating their valuable time to help organize PSF activities.
