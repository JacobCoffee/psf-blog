It is that time of year and we are excited to start the official **Python Developers Survey for 2019**! In 2018, the Python Software Foundation together with JetBrains conducted an official Python Developers Survey for the second time. Over 20,000 developers from almost 150 different countries participated.. With this third iteration of the official Python Developers Survey, we aim to identify how the Python development world looks today and how it compares to the last two years. The results of the survey will serve as a major source of knowledge about the current state of the Python community and how it is changing over the years, so we encourage you to participate and make an invaluable contribution to this community resource. The survey takes approximately 10 minutes to complete. [Please take a few minutes to complete the 2019 Python Developers Survey!](https://surveys.jetbrains.com/s3/c9-python-developers-survey-2019) Your valuable opinion and feedback will help us better understand how Python developers use Python, related frameworks, tools, and technologies. We also hope you'll have fun going through the questions. The survey is organized in partnership between the Python Software Foundation and JetBrains. The Python Software Foundation distributes this survey through community channels only (such as this blog, Twitter, mailing lists, etc). After the survey is over, we will publish the aggregated results and randomly select 100 winners (those who complete the survey in its entirety), who will each receive an amazing **Python Surprise Gift Pack**.
