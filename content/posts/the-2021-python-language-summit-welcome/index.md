As attendees slowly filtered into the virtual event leading up to the official start time, they were clearly happy to see each other and have the chance to get together virtually even though PyCon US and the language summit have had to be remote for two years in a row. Although we would like to see each other in person again, one benefit of keeping the summit virtual this year was that more people were able to participate than usual.

Normally, the number of people attending would be small enough that there would be time for each person to take a moment to introduce themselves to the group. Since there were more participants than usual this year, [Łukasz Langa](https://twitter.com/llanga) walked us through a slide deck that had a page for each of the attendees. It was an international event, with participants attending from North America, South America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and Oceania.

After Łukasz finished the introductions, [Ewa Jodlowska](https://twitter.com/ewa_jodlowska) told us about the [code of conduct](https://us.pycon.org/2021/about/code-of-conduct/) and the [procedures](https://us.pycon.org/2021/about/code-of-conduct/attendee-procedure/) in place to help all participants feel welcome and have a positive experience.

With the [2021 Python Language Summit](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2021/05/the-2021-python-language-summit.html) off to a good start, we took a group photo and were ready to launch into the talks!
