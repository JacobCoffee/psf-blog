Every year, a small group of core developers from Python implementations such as CPython, PyPy, Jython, and more come together to share information, discuss problems, and seek consensus in order to help Python continue to flourish.  

The Python Language Summit features short presentations followed by group discussions. The topics can relate to the language itself, the standard library, the development process, documentation, packaging, and more! In 2021, the summit was held over two days by videoconference and was led by Mariatta Wijaya and Łukasz Langa.

If you weren't able to attend the summit, then you can still stay up to date with what's happening in the world of Python by reading blog posts about all of the talks that were given. Over the next few weeks, you'll be able to dive into all of the news from the summit so you can join in on the big conversations that are happening in the Python community.
