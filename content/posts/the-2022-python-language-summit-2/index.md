Python 3.11, if you haven’t heard, is fast. Over the past year, Microsoft has [funded a team](https://developers.slashdot.org/story/21/05/17/0225252/microsoft-funds-a-team-with-guido-van-rossum-to-double-the-speed-of-python) – led by core developers Mark Shannon and Guido van Rossum – to work full-time on making CPython faster. With additional funding from Bloomberg, and help from a wide range of other contributors from the community, [the results have borne fruit](https://docs.python.org/3.11/whatsnew/3.11.html#faster-cpython). On the pyperformance benchmarks [at the time of the beta release](https://github.com/faster-cpython/ideas/blob/main/main-vs-310.rst), Python 3.11 was around 1.25x faster than Python 3.10, a phenomenal achievement.

But there is more still to be done. At [the 2022 Python Language Summit](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/05/the-2022-python-language-summit_01678898482.html), Mark Shannon presented on where the Faster CPython project aims to go next. The future’s fast.

The first problem Shannon raised was a problem of measurements. In order to know how to make Python faster, we need to know how slow Python is currently. But how slow at doing *what*, exactly?

Good benchmarks are vital for a project that aims to optimise Python for general usage. For that, the Faster CPython team needs the help of the community at large. The project “needs more benchmarks,” Shannon said – it needs to understand more precisely what the user base at large is using Python for, how they’re doing it, and what makes it slow at the moment (if it is slow!).

A benchmark, Shannon explained, is “just a program that we can time”. Anybody with a benchmark – or even just a suggestion for a benchmark! – that they believe is representative of a larger project they’re working on is invited to submit them to the issue tracker at the [python/pyperformance repository](https://github.com/python/pyperformance/issues) on GitHub.

Nonetheless, the Faster CPython team has plenty to be getting on with in the meantime.

Much of the optimisation work in 3.11 has been achieved through the implementation of [PEP 659](https://peps.python.org/pep-0659/), a “specializing adaptive interpreter”. The adaptive interpreter that Shannon and his team have introduced tracks individual bytecodes at various points in a program’s execution. When it spots an opportunity, a bytecode may be “quickened”: this means that a slow bytecode, that can do many things, is replaced by the interpreter with a more specialised bytecode that is very good at doing one specific thing. The work on PEP 659 has now largely been done, but major parts, such as dynamic specialisations of for-loops and binary operations, are still to be completed.

Shannon noted that Python also has essentially the same memory consumption in 3.11 as it did in 3.10. This is something he’d like to work on: a smaller memory overhead generally means fewer [reference-counting](https://docs.python.org/3.6/c-api/intro.html#objects-types-and-reference-counts) operations in the virtual machine, a lower [garbage-collection](https://devguide.python.org/garbage_collector/) overhead, and smoother performance as a result of it all.

Another big remaining avenue for optimisations is the question of C extensions. CPython’s easy interface with C is its major advantage over other Python implementations such as [PyPy](https://www.pypy.org/), where incompatibilities with C extensions are one of the biggest hurdles for adoption by users. The optimisation work that has been done in CPython 3.11 has largely ignored the question of extension modules, but Shannon now wants to open up the possibility of exposing low-level function APIs to the virtual machine, reducing the overhead time of communicating between Python code and C code.

## Is that a JIT I see on the horizon?

Lastly, but certainly not least, Shannon said, “everybody wants a JIT compiler… even if it doesn’t make sense yet”.

A JIT (“just-in-time”) compiler is the name given for a compiler that dynamically detects where performance bottlenecks exist in a program as the program is running. Once these bottlenecks have been identified, the JIT compiles these parts of the program on-the-fly into native [machine code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code) in order to speed things up. It’s a similar idea to Shannon’s PEP 659, but goes much further, since the specialising adaptive interpreter never goes beyond the bytecode level.

The idea of using a JIT compiler for Python is hardly new. [PyPy](https://www.pypy.org)’s JIT compiler is the major source of the large performance gains the project has over CPython in some areas. Third-party projects, such as [pyjion](https://github.com/tonybaloney/Pyjion) and [numba](https://github.com/numba/numba), bring just-in-time compilation to CPython that’s just a `pip install` away. Integrating a JIT into the core of CPython, however, would be materially different.

Shannon has historically voiced scepticism about the wisdom of introducing a JIT compiler into CPython itself, and said that work on introducing one is still some way off. A JIT, according to Shannon, will probably not arrive until 3.13 at the earliest, given the amount of lower-hanging fruit that is still to be worked on. The first step towards a JIT, he explained, would be to implement a *trace interpreter*, which would allow for better testing of concepts and lay the groundwork for future changes.

## Playing nicely with the other Python projects

The gains Shannon’s team has achieved are hugely impressive, and likely to benefit the community as a whole in a profound way. But various problems lie on the horizon. Sam Gross’s [proposal for a version of CPython without the Global Interpreter Lock](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/05/the-2022-python-language-summit-python_11.html) (the `nogil` fork) has potential for speeding up multithreaded Python code in very different ways to the Faster CPython team’s work – but it could also be problematic for some of the optimisations that have already been implemented, many of which assume that the GIL exists. Eric Snow’s [dream of achieving multiple subinterpreters within a single process](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/05/the-2022-python-language-summit-per.html), meanwhile, will have a smaller performance impact on single-threaded code compared to `nogil`, but could still create some minor complications for Shannon’s team.
