Every year, just before the start of PyCon US, around 30 core developers, triagers, and special guests gather for the Python Language Summit: an all-day event of talks where the future direction of Python is discussed. The summit in 2022 was the first in-person summit since 2019, due to disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic in 2020-21.

This year's summit was covered by Alex Waygood.
