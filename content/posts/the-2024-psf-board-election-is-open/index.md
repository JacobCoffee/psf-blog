It’s time to cast your vote! Voting is open starting today Tuesday, July 2nd, through Tuesday, July 16th, 2024 2:00 pm UTC. Check the [Elections page](https://www.python.org/nominations/elections/) to see how much time you have left to vote.  

#### How to Vote

If you are a voting member of the PSF that affirmed your intention to participate in this year’s election, you will receive an email from “OpaVote Voting Link <noreply@opavote.com>” with a link to your ballot. The subject line will read “Python Software Foundation Board of Directors Election 2024”. If you haven’t seen your ballot by Wednesday, please check your spam folder for a message from “noreply@opavote.com”. If you don’t see anything get in touch by emailing psf-elections@python.org so we can look into your account and make sure we have the most up-to-date email for you.

  
Three seats on the board are open, but you can approve as many of the 19 candidates as you like. We’re delighted by how many of you are willing to contribute to the Python community by serving on the PSF Board! Make sure you take some time to look at all [the nominee statements](https://www.python.org/nominations/elections/2024-python-software-foundation-board/nominees/) and choose your candidates carefully. ATTN: Choose carefully before you press the **big green vote button**. Once your vote is cast, it cannot be changed.
