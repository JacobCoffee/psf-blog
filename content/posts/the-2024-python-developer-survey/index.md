We are excited to share the [results of the eighth official annual Python Developers Survey](https://lp.jetbrains.com/python-developers-survey-2024/). This survey is done yearly as a collaborative effort between the Python Software Foundation and [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/). Check out [Michael Kennedy](https://fosstodon.org/@mkennedy)'s [The State of Python 2025](https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2025/08/the-state-of-python-2025/) blog post, on the [JetBrains blog,](https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) which reflects his personal analysis and opinions on the data. Responses were collected October and November of 2024. More than 30,000 Python developers and enthusiasts from almost 200 countries and regions participated in the survey to reveal the current state of the language and the ecosystem around it.
