It’s time to cast your vote! Voting for the 2025 PSF Board Election is open starting today Tuesday, September 2nd, 2:00 pm UTC, through Tuesday, September 16th, 2:00 pm UTC.  

## How to Vote

If you are a voting member of the PSF who [affirmed your intention to participate](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/07/affirm-your-psf-membership-voting-status.html) in this year’s election or you voted in last year’s election, you will receive an email today from “OpaVote Voting Link <noreply@opavote.com>” with a link to your ballot. The subject line will read “Python Software Foundation Board of Directors Election 2025”. If you haven’t seen your ballot by Wednesday, please first check your spam folder for a message from “noreply@opavote.com”. If you can’t find the ballot email from OpaVote please get in touch by emailing psf-elections@pyfound.org so we can look into your account and make sure we have the most up-to-date email for you.

Four seats on the board are open, but you can vote to approve as many of the 13 candidates as you like. We’re delighted by how many of you are willing to contribute to the Python community by serving on the PSF Board! Make sure you take some time to look at all [the nominee statements](https://www.python.org/nominations/elections/2025-python-software-foundation-board/nominees/) and choose your candidates carefully.

**ATTN:** Choose carefully before you press the **big green vote button**. Once your vote is cast, it cannot be changed.  

## Who can vote?

You need to be a Contributing, Supporting, or Fellow member and have affirmed your voting intention by August 26th, 2:00 pm UTC, to vote in this election. Per last year’s Bylaw change that allows for [simplifying the voter affirmation process by treating past voting activity as intent to continue voting](https://github.com/python/psf-bylaws/compare/a35a6071de181adbb7a160d5d1447e7b0272359c...6bac449), if you voted last year, you have been automatically added to the 2025 voter roll. *Please note: If you removed or changed your email on psfmember.org, you may not automatically be added to this year's voter roll.*

Reminder that if you were formerly a Managing member, your membership has been updated to Contributing as of June 25th, 2025, per last year’s [Bylaw change that merged Managing and Contributing memberships](https://github.com/psf/bylaws/compare/a35a6071de181adbb7a160d5d1447e7b0272359c...359cbc540f2f6bf00bc46b9dbe3e00a950612c27).
