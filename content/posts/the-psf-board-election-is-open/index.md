It’s time to cast your vote! Voting takes place from Monday, June 20 AoE, through Thursday, June 30, 2022 AoE. Check [here](https://www.python.org/nominations/elections/) to see how much time you have left to vote. If you are a voting member of the PSF, you will get an email from “Helios Voting Bot <no-reply@mail.heliosvoting.org>” with your ballot, subject line will read “Vote: Python Software Foundation Board of Directors Election 2022”. If you haven’t seen your ballot by Tuesday, please 1) check your spam folder for a message from “no-reply@mail.heliosvoting.org” and if you don’t see anything 2) get in touch by emailing [psf-elections@python.org](mailto:psf-elections@python.org) so we can make sure we have the most up to date email for you.

This might be the largest number of nominees we’ve ever had! Make sure you schedule some time to [look at all their statements](https://www.python.org/nominations/elections/2022-python-software-foundation-board/nominees/). We’re overwhelmed by how many of you are willing to contribute to the Python community by serving on the PSF board.

Who can vote? You need to be a Contributing, Managing, Supporting, or Fellow member as of June 15, 2022 to vote in this election.
