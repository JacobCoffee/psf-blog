The Python Software Foundation is happy to announce the creation of the Developer-in-Residence role. The Developer-in-Residence will work full-time for one year to assist CPython volunteer maintainers and the Steering Council. Areas of responsibility will include addressing backlog, analytical research to understand the project's volunteer hours and funding, investigation of project priorities and their tasks going forward, and begin working on those priorities. An extension beyond the first year will be based on the documented priorities this role creates, available funding, and community goals. Inspired by the Django Fellowship Program's success ([https://www.djangoproject.com/fundraising/#fellowship-program](https://www.djangoproject.com/fundraising/#fellowship-program)), the position is the result of a 2019 decision by the PSF board to strategically increase the PSF's focus to support CPython by helping fund the hiring of a full-time employee. In the early months of 2020, the Python Steering Council worked on presenting a road map at PyCon US 2020 that would unveil this support. Little did we know, 2020 held different plans for us all! Regardless of circumstances, the group put together [a recording outlining the Steering Council's priorities and how funding full-time support was put on hold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX8fGuh4T_o) (the talk is worth checking out!). Fast forward approximately a year, we are picking up from where we left off! Thanks to the [support from sponsors such as Google](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2021/02/welcoming-google-as-visionary-sponsor.html), this effort is funded for one year and moving forward. The PSF is currently accepting applications for the role. The job post has been shared with the Python core developers via their mailing list. You can check the post via [their public archive](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/python-committers@python.org/thread/QRKY4T7UCFQH4ZUPJT5IXSSIPXNLTCGK/).  
  
The PSF is a non-profit that supports the Python community using corporate sponsorships, grants, and donations.
