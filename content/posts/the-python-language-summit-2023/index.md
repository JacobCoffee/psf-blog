Every year, just before the start of PyCon US, core developers, triagers, and special guests gather for the Python Language Summit: an all-day event of talks where the future direction of Python is discussed. The Language Summit 2023 included three back-to-back talks on the C API, an update on work towards making the Global Interpreter Lock optional, and a discussion on how to tackle burnout in the community. This year's summit received around 45 attendees, and the summit was covered by Alex Waygood.
