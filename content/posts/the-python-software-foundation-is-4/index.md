Summary: After [announcing earlier this summer](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2021/06/update-on-python-software-foundation.html) that Ewa Jodlowska is leaving after ten years of service, the PSF has begun its search for the organization's next Executive Director. Interested? [You can apply here today](https://candidates.perrettlaver.com/vacancies/2549/executive_director/).

  

The Python Software Foundation Board of Directors has begun the search for its next Executive Director. We’re looking for a leader who aligns with the PSF’s mission and is able to lead an established, successful and growing organization into its next stage.

## What is the PSF?

The PSF is the 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation that holds the intellectual property rights behind the Python programming language:

  

The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers.

— [https://www.python.org/psf/mission/](https://www.python.org/psf/mission/)

  

To meet the Foundation’s mission, the PSF employs a growing team of [8 staff members](https://www.python.org/psf/records/staff/) as well as several contractors supporting specific initiatives. We produce PyCon US, support development of CPython, The Python Package Index, and the open-source Python ecosystem, support regional Python conferences and workshops around the world, and fund Python related development with our grants program.

  

For more details about the PSF, you can read our [Annual Impact Report](https://www.python.org/psf/annual-report/2020/). Additional information, including 990s and reports from past PSF board meetings, can be found on our [public records](https://www.python.org/psf/records/) webpage.

## The duties of the Executive Director

The PSF Executive Director fulfills several duties within the organization to promote the success of the Foundation’s mission as well as to secure its long term health. This includes the creation of an annual budget, overseeing operations and fundraising efforts, as well as managing the PSF staff and community relations.

  

The Executive Director plays a critical role in the development and execution of PSF programs and initiatives that fall within the mission of the PSF. In addition to managing the PSF staff, the Executive Director works with the PSF Board of Directors, the Python Steering Council, PSF Working Groups and the broader Python community on events like PyCon US and other strategic projects and alliances.
