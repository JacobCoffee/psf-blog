PSF Board elections are a chance for the community to choose representatives to help the PSF create a vision for and build the future of the Python community. This year, there are 4 seats open on the PSF Board. Check out who is currently on the PSF Board on [our website](https://www.python.org/psf/board/). (Dawn Wages, Jannis Leidel, Kushal Das, and Simon Willison are at the end of their current terms.)

#### Office Hours Information

This year, the PSF Board is dedicating a few of their [regular Office Hour sessions](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/08/ask-questions-or-tell-us-what-you-think.html) on the [PSF Discord](https://discord.gg/4Hm36PPgpG) to the topic of the election. This is your chance to connect with current board members to ask questions and learn more about what being a part of the Board entails. The two upcoming Office Hour sessions will be dedicated to the topic of the election:  

-   [Tuesday, July 8th, 1 PM UTC](https://discord.gg/XZRseGBpwb?event=1278055289689473045) - Nominations
-   [Tuesday, August 12th, 9 PM UTC](https://discord.gg/XZRseGBpwb?event=1278055444526403675) - Membership & general election questions

We welcome you to join the [PSF Discord](https://discord.gg/4Hm36PPgpG) to participate in Office Hours. The server is moderated by PSF Staff and locked between office hours sessions. If you’re new to Discord, check out some [Discord Basics](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/sections/360008206871-Discord-Basics) to help you get started.

#### Who runs for the Board?

#### Nomination info

You can nominate yourself or someone else. We encourage you to reach out to people before you nominate them to ensure they are enthusiastic about the potential of joining the Board. **Nominations open on Tuesday, July 29th, 2:00 pm UTC**, so you have a few weeks to research the role and craft a nomination statement. **The nomination period ends on Tuesday, August 12th, 2:00 pm UTC**. There will be a 'call for nominations' blog post with more information and resources about nominations coming soon.
