If you're using an older Python without the most secure TLS implementation, this is the year to get serious about upgrading. Otherwise next June you may not be able to "pip install" packages from PyPI. PyPI's maintainer Donald Stufft [recently announced](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/distutils-sig/2017-January/029970.html) that python.org and related sites will begin disabling the old TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1. This change was imposed on us by our content delivery network, Fastly, in response to [a change imposed on them by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pdfs/15_12_18_SSL_Webinar_Press_Release_FINAL.pdf). In order to continue serving websites that take credit card payments, Fastly is required to disable the old, insecure versions of TLS. Since the PSF's servers, including PyPI, use Fastly, the old versions of TLS will be disabled as well. [Fastly wrote in October 2015](https://www.fastly.com/blog/securing-online-transactions-announcing-our-plan-tls-10-and-11-deprecation),  

> There have been serious and systemic security issues with earlier versions of TLS and its predecessor, SSL, including POODLE, Heartbleed, and LOGJAM. These threatened to break trust in fundamental methods of secure communication, exposing both you and your customers to breaches in security. The actions of the PCI DSS Council to maintain a high minimum bar are a step towards ensuring the security of all online business transactions.

There are two deadlines to upgrade your Python to a version with the latest TLS. The first comes soon, on April 30, 2017, when python.org sites without [Extended Validation Certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Validation_Certificate) will stop supporting TLS 1.0 and 1.1. These sites include:

-   testpypi.python.org
-   test.pypi.org
-   files.pythonhosted.org

  
[Warehouse](https://pypi.org/), the future successor to PyPI, will also be affected by April's deadline, since Warehouse serves files from files.pythonhosted.org. The more crucial deadline comes June 30, 2018. On that date all remaining python.org sites, including PyPI, will no longer support TSL 1.0 and 1.1. Older Python versions that do not implement TLSv1.2 will be prohibited from accessing PyPI. See below for instructions to check your interpreter's TLS version. [1](https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=8520#1) Stufft writes, "I am going to see about possibly organizing some scheduled 'brown outs' of TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 prior to the cut off dates to try and help folks find places that will need updates. Any scheduled brownouts will be posted to status.python.org prior to happening." Mac users should pay special attention. So far, the system Python shipped with MacOS does not yet support TLSv1.2 in any MacOS version; beginning next June these system Pythons will no longer be able to "pip install" packages. [2](https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=8520#2) Fortunately, it's easy to install a modern Python alongside the MacOS system Python. Either [download Python 3.6 from python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/), or for [Python 2.7 with the latest TLS, use Homebrew](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/). Both methods of installing Python will continue working after June 2018.

[**1\.**](https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=8520#top1) To check your Python interpreter's TLS version, install the "requests" package and run a command. For example, for Python 2: python2 -m pip install --upgrade requests  
python2 -c "import requests; print(requests.get('https://www.howsmyssl.com/a/check', verify=False).json()\['tls\_version'\])"  
Or Python 3: python3 -m pip install --upgrade requests  
python3 -c "import requests; print(requests.get('https://www.howsmyssl.com/a/check', verify=False).json()\['tls\_version'\])"  
If you see "TLS 1.2", your interpreter's TLS is up to date. If you see "TLS 1.0" or an error like "tlsv1 alert protocol version", then you must upgrade.

In the coming year, the Python Packaging Authority team will investigate porting pip to Apple's own "SecureTransport" library as an alternative to OpenSSL, which would allow old Python interpreters to use modern TLS with pip only. "This is a non-trivial amount of effort," writes Stufft, "I'm not sure it's going to get done." In the long run, the Python interpreter itself would easily keep up with TLS versions, if it didn't use OpenSSL on platforms like macOS and Windows where OpenSSL is not shipped with the OS. Cory Benfield and Christian Heimes propose to redesign the standard library's TLS interfaces to make it easier to swap OpenSSL with platform-native TLS implementations.
