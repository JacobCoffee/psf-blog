The PSF’s [Code of Conduct Working Group](https://wiki.python.org/psf/ConductWG/Charter) is a group of volunteers whose purpose is to foster a diverse and inclusive Python community by enforcing the [PSF Code of Conduct](https://policies.python.org/python.org/code-of-conduct/), along with providing guidance and recommendations to the Python community on codes of conduct, that supports the PSF mission support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers. The working group has recently committed to publishing annual transparency reports and we are pleased to share the [first report with you today, for the 2024 calendar year](https://policies.python.org/python.org/code-of-conduct/reports/PSF-Transparency-Report-2024.pdf). The initial transparency report took some time to produce, but we've improved our recording keeping practices to make future reports easier to prepare. The Working Group spent time formalizing our record keeping this year, and going forward we plan to publish our transparency reports in the first quarter of each year. Each year’s report will be added to the same place in the [PSF's Code of Conduct documentation](https://policies.python.org/python.org/code-of-conduct/#transparency-reports) so that community members can easily access them. If you have thoughts or feedback on how to make these reports more useful, we welcome you to send us an email at conduct-wg@python.org.
