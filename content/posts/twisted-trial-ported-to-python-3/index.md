**Twisted**, as many of you know, is an asynchronous, or event driven networking framework written in Python ([https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki)). **Twisted** has been around for about a decade, offers many features, including low-level primitives and high-level interfaces, and works with many protocols (including HTTP, XMPP, NNTP, IMAP, SSH, IRC, FTP).

Due to its maturity and complexity, **Twisted** requires a lot of time and effort to be completely ported to Python 3. Fortunately, the PSF was able to help fund some of this work; one recent result is the release of **Twisted 15.4,** which includes **Twisted’**s standard test-runner, **Trial** (codenamed "Trial by Fire"). The PSF Grant allowed core developer and **Twisted** release manager,  
Amber (HawkOwl) Brown, to port **Trial** to Python 3. She recently sent the PSF this announcement:

> “Just wanting to let you all know that a **Twisted** with the PSF-funded **Trial Py3** port is now released. And a little example of it in action:  
> [https://asciinema.org/a/cthr9xezlt8mxg5dp0n73fzc9](https://asciinema.org/a/cthr9xezlt8mxg5dp0n73fzc9). Again, many thanks for accepting the grant proposal – the ability to dedicate a significant chunk of time to this work has meant it was completed well sooner than if the grant had not been accepted.”

Due to certain differences between Python 3 and Python 2 (e.g., removal of ClassType and unbound methods), Amber tells us that the porting of **Trial** required a rewriting and retesting of the test suite loader. The work is mostly done and the current port duplicates most of **Trial**’s previous functionality with the exception of its distributed test runner (`DistTrialRunner`). Specifically, the PSF grant allowed Amber to perform the following steps:

> \- Complete and test the **Trial** unittest loader

> \- Fix the remaining failing **Trial** tests

> \- Create a tool which runs only the portions of **Twisted** that have been ported to Python 3 for use in **Twisted** development

> \- Break up the port into smaller pieces, put them up for review, and address the review comments

> \- Merge the reviewed portions

**Trial**’s features–a front-end, the ability to handle Deferreds and asynchronous tests, and the capacity to build testcase-duration reactors, make testing much easier. The **Twisted** team will now be able to use **Trial** for continued Python 3 porting, while users of **Twisted** will be able to test their codebases more easily as they port them to Python 3. Because of **Trial**, we can look forward to **Twisted 15.5** in the near future (and hope to see more users' code ported to Python 3, as well). As Amber tells us,

> "15.5, coming soon, will come with another handful of ported modules, and the `twistd` application (a daemoniser + plugin runner, the recommended way of spawning long-running Twisted services)."

The PSF sends its gratitude and congratulations to Amber Brown and the **Twisted** team on this important accomplishment.
