Two upcoming events provide a good opportunity to jump into Jython or Python development.

First, there's [a Jython sprint](http://jython.eventwax.com/jython-sprint) being held in San Francisco on Saturday, February 16th. The sprinters are concentrating on tasks for Jython 2.5, following the newly updated [Jython road map](http://wiki.python.org/jython/RoadMap).

A week later on Saturday February 23rd, we're holding an online [Python Bug Day](http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonBugDay). Participants will meet in the #python-dev channel on IRC, and look at open bugs and patches in [Python's bug tracker](http://bugs.python.org). Last month's bug day closed 37 issues; will we do even better this month?
