After ten years of exceptional service to the Python Software Foundation, the PSF Executive Director Ewa Jodlowska has decided to leave the Foundation at the end of 2021. We wish to thank Ewa for her many years of service and contributions to not only the Foundation but to the entire Python community. It’s safe to say the PSF, PyCon and the whole Python community would not be where it is today if not for Ewa. In preparation for Ewa’s departure, the Python Software Foundation will begin a search to find a new Executive Director. The Executive Director is a key player in helping the Foundation pursue our mission “to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers.” The Board of Directors will work together with the Staff, the outgoing Executive Director, and the community in developing a timeline for the transition as well as posting periodic updates on the search when it formally begins. Please keep an eye on the PSF blog for these updates as well as the forthcoming job listing.
