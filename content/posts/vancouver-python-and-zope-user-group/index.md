The [Vancouver Python Zope User Group](http://www.vanpyz.org/) has donated the proceeds of the 2006 Vancouver Python Workshop, amounting to CAD$5770, to the Python Software Foundation. The PSF thanks the user group for their support.

The organizers of the Workshop would like to thank their organizers, speakers and everyone who attended. They would also like to thank their sponsors: [ActiveState](http://www.activestate.com/), [SafeSoftware](http://www.safe.com/), and [tummy.com](http://www.tummy.com/) - your support was invaluable!
