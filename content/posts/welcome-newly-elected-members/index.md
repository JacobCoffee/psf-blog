The Foundation recently held elections after PyCon 2013, and the results are in! All members of the PSF are nominated by an existing member for their work in the Python community. We have quite a diverse set of community members joining us this year, with representation across many countries and individuals contributing to many areas of the Python world.  
As with years past, a group of individuals known for their contributions of code, either to Python implementations or other projects in the Python ecosystem, were elected. We also have a number of members recognized for their work with PyCon and other Python conferences around the world. Community effort is another theme and we have several members known for their work building and expanding their local Python communities as well as the global community. Please join us in welcoming all of the new members to the Foundation!

Eight board members were re-elected to their positions, and three new members were elected to join the board under Van Lindberg's chairmanship. The new board members are:

-   Brett Cannon
-   Alex Gaynor
-   Lynn Root
