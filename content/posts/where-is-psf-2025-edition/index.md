#### Where to Find the PSF Online

One of the main ways we reach people for news and information about the PSF and Python is on social media. There’s been a lot of uncertainty around X as well as some other platforms popping up, so we wanted to share a brief round-up of other places you can find us:

As always, if you are looking for technical support rather than news about the foundation, we have collected links and resources here for people who are new or looking to get deeper into the Python programming language: https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/ You can also ask questions about Python or the PSF on Python’s Discuss forum. The [PSF category](https://discuss.python.org/c/python-software-foundation/9) is the best place to reach us on the forum!
