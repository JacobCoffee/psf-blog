## Where to Find the PSF Online  

One of the main ways we reach people for news and information about the PSF and Python is Twitter. There’s been a lot of uncertainty around that platform recently, so we wanted to share a brief round up of other places you can find us:  

-   **Read our blog**: It’s here! You found it! You can always find our latest updates here at [pyfound.blogspot.com](http://pyfound.blogspot.com).

As always, if you are looking for technical support rather than news about the foundation, we have collected links and resources here for people who are new or looking to get deeper into the Python programming language: [https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/) You can also ask questions about Python or the PSF at [discuss.python.org](https://discuss.python.org/)
